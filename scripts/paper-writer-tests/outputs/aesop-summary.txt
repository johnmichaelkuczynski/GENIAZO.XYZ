============================================================

In my tales and fables, I have often emphasized a simple yet profound truth: deeds reveal true character more than words. This core thesis is woven throughout my stories, illustrating that actions speak louder than promises. It is easy to make grand declarations, but it is through our deeds that our true intentions and character are laid bare. The world is filled with those who promise much but deliver little, and my tales serve as a reminder that it is the faithful worker, the one who acts without the need for constant reassurance or empty promises, who truly deserves our respect and trust.

Consider the tale of the fox and the crow. The crow, seduced by the fox's flattering words, loses its meal. Here, the fox's actions—its cunning and deceit—reveal its true nature, not its sweet words. In this story, the crow learns a valuable lesson: beware of those who speak with honeyed tongues but harbor deceitful intentions. It is a reminder that we must be vigilant and discerning, recognizing that actions, not words, are the true measure of character.

Loyalty is another theme I hold dear. It is not enough to simply declare allegiance; one must demonstrate it through consistent actions. Loyalty should be directed towards true benefactors, not opportunists who switch allegiances at the drop of a hat. Those who switch allegiances are despised by all sides, as they lack the steadfastness that true loyalty demands. In my tales, I often highlight the importance of cultivating the favor of genuine benefactors. These are the individuals or entities that have proven their worth through their deeds, not just their words.

Consider the tale of the dog and the wolf. The dog, well-fed and cared for, remains loyal to his master who provides for him. The wolf, on the other hand, is tempted by the prospect of easy gain but ultimately realizes that true freedom comes with a cost. The dog’s loyalty is rewarded with security and sustenance, while the wolf’s opportunism leads to a life of uncertainty and hardship. This story underscores the value of loyalty to those who have shown themselves to be true friends and benefactors.

Kindness, too, must be tempered with wisdom. It should not be extended to those who will harm you. The tale of the farmer and the snake illustrates this principle. The farmer, moved by compassion, takes in a frozen snake, only to be bitten once it revives. The snake’s nature is unchanged by the farmer’s kindness, and the farmer pays the price for his misplaced trust. This story serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us that kindness must be coupled with discernment, lest we fall victim to those who would exploit our goodwill.

Prudent decision-making is a recurring theme in my fables. One must count the cost before committing to any action. The tale of the ant and the grasshopper is a prime example. The ant, diligent and foresighted, prepares for the winter, while the grasshopper, carefree and shortsighted, faces starvation. The ant’s prudent planning ensures survival, while the grasshopper’s lack of foresight leads to its downfall. This story teaches the importance of careful consideration and planning, urging us to weigh the consequences of our actions before leaping into the unknown.

In conclusion, my fables are rich with lessons that emphasize the importance of deeds over words. They remind us that true character is revealed through actions, not empty promises. Loyalty should be directed towards those who have proven themselves through their deeds, and kindness should be extended with caution. Finally, prudent decision-making is essential for navigating the complexities of life. These timeless lessons continue to resonate, guiding us towards a life of integrity, wisdom, and discernment.The wicked deserve no quarter from those who would serve justice. I have seen too many good souls destroyed by extending mercy to those who repay kindness with cruelty. In serving the wicked, expect no reward and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains.

My tale of the eagle and the arrow drives this point home with brutal clarity. The eagle, struck by an arrow fletched with its own feathers, realizes the bitter irony of its fate. "How much more grievous is it," the dying bird laments, "to be destroyed by our own feathers!" Those who aid the wicked often provide the very tools of their own destruction.

Commitment demands everything or nothing. Whatever you do, do with all your might. Half-hearted efforts yield half-hearted results. The tortoise understood this when racing the hare. While the hare relied on natural talent and grew complacent, the tortoise committed fully to each deliberate step. Victory belonged not to the swift but to the steadfast.

This principle extends beyond individual effort to the very fabric of character. Those who switch allegiances are despised by all sides. I have watched countless souls attempt to serve multiple masters, believing cleverness could substitute for conviction. They discover too late that betrayal marks a man permanently. Trust, once broken, cannot be mended with words alone.

The earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to the murderer. Even nature recognizes the stench of treachery and turns away from those who violate sacred bonds. Society functions only when commitments hold meaning, when promises carry weight beyond mere convenience.

Labor remains the foundation of all blessing. None but those who work are entitled to eat. This truth cuts through every excuse, every attempt to claim reward without effort. The drone who consumes the honey while contributing nothing to the hive earns only contempt from those who toil.

Yet wisdom requires knowing when effort is wasted. How can you pretend to prescribe for others when you are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin? The physician who cannot cure himself has no business treating others. Self-knowledge prevents the folly of offering solutions we ourselves have never mastered.

Every tale is not to be believed. Words flow easily from tongues that have never tasted hardship. I judge not by eloquent speeches but by consistent action over time. One swallow does not make a summer, and one good deed does not establish character.

The vanquished cock immediately came out of his corner and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery. True victory requires no boasting, no elaborate ceremony. It speaks through results alone.

Let the deed show. These three words contain more wisdom than volumes of philosophy. They cut through pretense, expose hollow promises, and reveal the authentic measure of any soul.I watch men scramble for advantage, switching allegiances like weathervanes in a storm. Those who switch allegiances are despised by all sides. The traitor earns no lasting friendship, for everyone knows what manner of creature they harbor. Better to stand firm with honest enemies than to embrace false friends who will abandon you at the first sign of trouble.

Count the cost before you commit yourselves. This lesson echoes through every fable I have told, yet men persist in making grand gestures without measuring their capacity to fulfill them. The builder who begins without sufficient stone creates only ruins. The warrior who charges without counting his enemy's strength feeds the crows.

Kindness should not be extended to those who will harm you once restored. I have seen too many good souls nurse vipers back to health, only to receive venom as their reward. Mercy has its place, but wisdom must guide its application. The scorpion will sting regardless of your compassion - it is their nature.

In serving the wicked, expect no reward and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains. Evil masters offer no loyalty in return for faithful service. They consume devotion like fire consumes wood, leaving only ash where dedication once burned bright. Better to serve honest masters poorly than to serve corrupt ones well.

It is easy to kick a man that is down. Cowards reveal themselves in moments when their target cannot strike back. True strength shows itself in restraint, in lifting up rather than grinding down. The pack that turns on its wounded member has forgotten what separates beast from man.

Conquer, but conquer to your cost. Victory without sacrifice teaches nothing. The general who wins through overwhelming force learns no lessons for the next campaign. The student who succeeds without effort gains no wisdom from struggle. Easy triumphs breed soft character.

Whatever you do, do with all your might. Half-hearted effort produces half-hearted results. The farmer who plants carelessly reaps poorly. The craftsman who works without passion creates objects without soul. Excellence demands complete commitment, not partial attention.

Cultivate the favor of your true benefactors, not opportunistic ones. Gratitude flows toward those who helped when helping carried risk, not toward those who appeared only after success seemed certain. The friend who stands beside you in poverty proves more valuable than ten who arrive with your prosperity.

These truths require no elaborate proof. They emerge from observing human nature stripped of its pretenses, revealed in moments of crisis when masks fall away.Every tale is not to be believed. Men dress their lies in fine clothes, hoping appearance will substitute for truth. The smooth talker weaves stories that sound reasonable until examined closely. Then contradictions emerge like cracks in poorly mixed mortar.

I learned this watching those who promised much but delivered little. They spoke of grand plans while their hands remained idle. Their words multiplied like rabbits in spring, but their deeds remained as scarce as honest politicians.

The earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to the murderer. Nature itself rejects those who violate fundamental laws. No amount of clever argument can wash clean what conscience knows to be stained. The guilty carry their crimes like shadows that follow them everywhere.

This applies beyond murder to all forms of betrayal. Those who switch allegiances are despised by all sides. The turncoat finds no welcome in either camp. His former allies remember his treachery, while his new companions question his loyalty. He becomes a man without a country, trusted by none.

Count the cost before you commit yourselves. Enthusiasm without calculation leads to disaster. The builder who starts without measuring his materials finds himself with walls half-built and pockets empty. The merchant who expands without considering market conditions discovers his warehouses full of goods no one wants.

I have seen ambitious men leap before they looked, then wonder why they landed in thorns. They confused motion with progress, activity with achievement. True wisdom calculates not just the effort required to begin, but the resources needed to complete.

Labor is the source of every blessing. None but those who work are entitled to eat. This offends those who believe the world owes them comfort without effort. They point to inherited wealth, to lucky breaks, to unfair advantages others possess. Yet even inherited wealth came from someone's labor, even if not their own.

The ant understands what the grasshopper refuses to learn. Summer's abundance must prepare for winter's scarcity. Those who consume today what they should save for tomorrow discover that seasons change regardless of their preferences.

One swallow does not make a summer. Single examples prove nothing about general patterns. The fool sees one honest politician and concludes all politicians are honest. The optimist meets one kind stranger and assumes all strangers are kind. Wisdom requires larger samples before drawing conclusions.

How can you pretend to prescribe for others, when you are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin? The physician who limps while preaching health inspires little confidence. The teacher who cannot master his own subject has no business instructing others. Credibility flows from demonstrated competence, not proclaimed expertise.I watch men serve the wicked and express shock when evil repays them with evil. In serving the wicked, expect no reward and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains. The scorpion will sting because stinging is its nature, not because you failed to carry it gently across the river.

Kindness should not be extended to those who will harm you once restored. The snake you warm in your bosom will bite you when it recovers strength. This seems harsh to those who mistake weakness for virtue. They confuse enabling with compassion, surrender with mercy.

The earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to the murderer. Nature itself recognizes justice. Even elements turn away from those who violate fundamental order. Yet humans often welcome what nature rejects, calling it tolerance when it is merely foolishness.

Those who switch allegiances are despised by all sides. The turncoat pleases no one, trusted by none. His former allies see him as traitor. His new allies see him as opportunist. He gains temporary advantage but permanent isolation.

Every tale is not to be believed. The liar's greatest weapon is the honest man's assumption that others share his truthfulness. Gullibility masquerades as good nature. Skepticism appears cynical to those who prefer comfortable illusions to uncomfortable realities.

It is easy to kick a man that is down. Cowards become brave when their target cannot fight back. They mistake cruelty for strength, abuse for dominance. True power protects the vulnerable. False power attacks them.

The vanquished Cock immediately came out of his corner, and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery. Defeat often teaches what victory cannot. The humbled learn wisdom the proud refuse. Sometimes we must lose everything to discover what truly matters.

Conquer, but conquer to your cost. Every victory demands payment. The wise general counts casualties before declaring triumph. The ambitious merchant calculates total expenses before claiming profit. Nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice.

Let the deed show. Actions reveal character more clearly than words conceal it. The boastful promise much and deliver little. The faithful promise little and deliver much. Watch hands, not mouths. Judge results, not intentions.

Whatever you do, do with all your might. Half-hearted effort produces half-hearted results. The lukewarm succeed at nothing because they commit to nothing. Excellence requires total dedication. Mediocrity accepts partial commitment.The earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to the murderer. Nature herself rejects those who violate her fundamental laws. Even the elements turn away from corruption. There is no hiding place for the truly wicked.

How can you pretend to prescribe for others, when you are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin? The hypocrite physician limps while preaching health. The bankrupt merchant sells prosperity. Before you correct another's faults, examine your own mirror closely.

Kindness should not be extended to those who will harm you once restored. The snake bites the hand that warmed it. The rescued enemy becomes tomorrow's assassin. Mercy without wisdom becomes cruelty to the innocent. Compassion must be tempered with judgment.

Those who switch allegiances are despised by all sides. The turncoat pleases no one permanently. His former friends call him traitor. His new allies call him opportunist. Loyalty may cost you battles, but betrayal costs you character.

One swallow does not make a summer. A single success does not guarantee lasting prosperity. The lucky gambler believes skill created his fortune. The occasional winner thinks himself permanently blessed. Patterns matter more than isolated incidents.

Count the cost before you commit yourselves. The wise builder calculates materials before laying foundations. The prudent warrior assesses strength before declaring war. Enthusiasm without planning breeds disaster. Passion without preparation produces failure.

In serving the wicked, expect no reward and be thankful if you escape injury for your pains. Evil masters reward faithful service with suspicion. They fear those who know their secrets. Virtue in wicked service becomes dangerous knowledge.
