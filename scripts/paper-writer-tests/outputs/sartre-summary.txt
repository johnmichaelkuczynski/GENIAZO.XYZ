============================================================

In the realm of existentialism, I assert that existence precedes essence. This fundamental tenet underpins much of my philosophical work. It suggests that we are not born with a predetermined nature or purpose; rather, we define who we are through our actions and choices. Our essence, or intrinsic nature, is not something that is given to us at birth but is something that we continuously shape throughout our lives.

From an early age, we experience alienation and reification. These concepts, which begin in childhood, extend into our working lives, affecting how we perceive ourselves and the world around us. Alienation is a sense of estrangement, a feeling that we are disconnected from our true selves or the world. Reification, on the other hand, involves making something abstract more concrete or real, often leading us to view ourselves and others as objects within a system.

In exploring the nature of existence, I have come to recognize the profound impact of alienation and reification, concepts that begin to shape our lives from childhood. As children, we encounter the world as a series of objects and phenomena that seem external to us. This initial estrangement, or alienation, from our surroundings is a fundamental experience that extends into our working lives. It is here that reification takes hold, as we begin to perceive ourselves and others as objects within a system, rather than as free agents capable of defining our own essence.

The world, as I perceive it, is a totality of phenomena intricately linked in a network of mutual references. Each object, each experience, is not isolated but exists in a relation of externality with other entities. This interconnectedness challenges the notion of fixed essences, suggesting instead that our identities are fluid, shaped by the interplay of our interactions with the world.

Our bodies, too, reflect this contingent nature. They are the forms through which we engage with the world, yet they are not fixed or essential. Instead, they are contingent, reflecting the necessity of our contingency. This understanding of the body underscores the existentialist view that we are not bound by any inherent essence but are free to redefine ourselves through our actions.

Freedom, in this context, is not merely a privilege but an obligation. It is the necessity to constantly redefine oneself, to choose one's path amidst the myriad possibilities that existence presents. This freedom is both exhilarating and daunting, as it places the responsibility of defining our essence squarely upon our shoulders.

In conclusion, the existentialist assertion that existence precedes essence challenges us to embrace the freedom and responsibility of self-definition. Alienation and reification may shape our experiences, but they do not determine our essence. Instead, we are called to engage with the world, to navigate its network of phenomena, and to continually redefine who we are through our choices and actions. This is the essence of existential freedom, a perpetual journey of becoming.The worker trapped in the machinery of production exemplifies this existential predicament most starkly. As a wage laborer, the worker becomes a worked Thing, alienated from their own praxis. This transformation reveals how the structures of society can obscure our fundamental freedom, making us forget that we are the authors of our own existence.

Yet even in this alienation lies the seed of liberation. The very recognition that "without work there would be no mode of production" points to human praxis as the foundation of all social reality. We create the world that then appears to dominate us. This is the cruel irony of reification - we become enslaved by our own creations, forgetting that we brought them into being.

The priority of praxis over worked matter remains absolute. No matter how thoroughly the capitalist system appears to reduce humans to mere objects, the creative capacity that built this system persists. We cannot be permanently transformed into things because we are the source of all transformation.

Language itself betrays this fundamental truth. When we speak, we reveal the structures of our body-for-the-Other, acknowledging that our existence is always relational, always in dialogue with otherness. Even our most private thoughts are shaped by this encounter with the external world.

Consider how genius manifests itself. The genius of Proust is not some mystical essence dwelling within him - it is the works of Proust. His identity as a genius exists only through his concrete literary productions. This exemplifies perfectly how existence precedes essence: Proust became a genius by writing, not the reverse.

This insight demolishes romantic notions of predetermined talent or destiny. We are not born with fixed natures waiting to unfold. Instead, we forge our identities through sustained engagement with the world, through the accumulation of choices and actions that gradually define who we are.

The anguish that accompanies this recognition is unavoidable. Freedom manifests itself through this anxiety precisely because it demands constant renewal of the self. There is no moment of rest, no final achievement of a stable identity. The Me must be perpetually remade through fresh acts of choice.

This coenesthetic affectivity - this pure, non-positional awareness of our own contingency - colors all our experiences. We cannot escape the knowledge that we might have been otherwise, that every aspect of our existence rests on no firmer foundation than our own choices.

The formal structure binding figure to ground in perception mirrors this existential condition. Just as objects appear meaningful only against their background, our identities emerge only through contrast with what we reject, what we refuse to become. We define ourselves as much through negation as through affirmation.

This is why bad faith proves so tempting. The weight of constant self-creation drives us toward the illusion of fixed nature, toward the comfort of believing ourselves determined by forces beyond our control.The worker under capitalism exemplifies this flight into bad faith most clearly. As a wage laborer, the worker becomes a worked Thing, surrendering their fundamental freedom to the practico-inert structures of economic necessity. They convince themselves that their alienation stems from external forces rather than from their own complicity in the system.

But this alienation begins much earlier. The child first encounters reification in family structures, learning to see themselves as object rather than subject. These early patterns of self-objectification become templates that we project onto our adult working lives. We mistake the contingent arrangements of our economic system for natural law.

Without work, there would be no mode of production - this obvious truth conceals a deeper reality. The priority of praxis over worked matter establishes the fundamental ground of human existence. We are beings who transform the world through action, yet we systematically deny this transformative power.

The body itself embodies this contradiction. It represents the contingent form taken by the necessity of my contingency. I must exist embodied, but the particular form of that embodiment remains radically contingent. Through my body, I encounter the world as a totality of phenomena linked in networks of mutual reference.

Language reveals the major structures of our body-for-the-Other, showing us how we appear to external consciousness. But this revelation comes emptily, as pure form without content. We learn the shape of our objectification without grasping its meaning.

These objective laws define a strictly objective center of reference, creating the illusion of a stable self that exists independently of our choices. We mistake this constructed center for our essential nature, forgetting that it emerges only through our ongoing projects and commitments.

The genius of Proust consists precisely in his works, not in some pre-existing capacity that made those works possible. This formulation captures the radical nature of human creativity. We do not express pre-given talents; we create both the work and ourselves as creators through the act of creation itself.

Every object appears against the ground of the world, manifesting itself through relations of externality with other phenomena. Similarly, every choice appears against the background of rejected possibilities, defining itself through what it excludes.

This formal structure proves necessary, not contingent. We cannot escape the figure-ground relationship that organizes both perception and existence. But within this necessary structure, everything remains radically open.

The constantly renewed obligation to remake the Me characterizes authentic existence. We cannot achieve ourselves once and for all. Each moment demands fresh commitment, renewed choice, continued creation of who we are becoming.

This is our burden and our glory: to exist without predetermined essence, to create meaning through action, to bear responsibility for what we make of ourselves.This responsibility terrifies us. We flee into bad faith, pretending our choices are forced upon us by circumstances, nature, or social roles. The waiter who identifies completely with his function, the woman who denies her freedom by claiming she "cannot help" her reactions—both refuse the anguish of authentic existence.

Bad faith operates through self-deception. We convince ourselves that we are things rather than consciousness, that our essence precedes our existence, that we have no choice but to be what we already are.

The body provides the most seductive escape route. We treat our physical form as the contingent vessel for necessary contingency, as if our embodied situation determines our possibilities rather than simply conditioning them. But the body remains my body, the particular angle from which I engage the world, not a prison that contains me.

Language reveals the major structures of our body-for-the-Other, showing us how we appear in the eyes of others. This external perspective can become another form of bad faith when we adopt it as our own truth. We begin to see ourselves as others see us, losing contact with our lived experience.

Coenesthetic affectivity—that dim awareness of our bodily existence—offers us the pure non-positional apprehension of colorless contingency. This background feeling of existing reminds us constantly that we are not necessary beings. We could always be otherwise.

The practico-inert realm seduces us with its apparent solidity. As wage laborers, we become worked Things, shaped by forces we did not choose. The priority of praxis over worked matter gets reversed. We forget that without work there would be no mode of production, that human activity creates the very structures that seem to dominate us.

This reversal produces alienation. We project the reification we first experienced in childhood onto our working lives, treating our own creative powers as foreign forces. The child who learns to see himself through adult eyes carries this alienated perspective into every subsequent relationship.

Yet even in the most oppressive circumstances, freedom persists. The worker remains consciousness, capable of transcending the immediate situation through imagination, reflection, and choice. No external force can eliminate the gap between what is and what might be.

This gap constitutes our freedom. Not freedom from all constraints, but freedom to choose our response to whatever constraints we face. Not the absence of situation, but the transcendence of any given situation toward possibilities we ourselves project.

The world as totality provides the horizon within which all particular choices occur. Every phenomenon links to every other in a network of mutual references. But this totality itself depends on consciousness to organize it, to select which connections matter, to determine what counts as relevant.

We are condemned to be free because we cannot escape the necessity of choosing, even when we choose not to choose.**The Body as Contingent Necessity**

My body exemplifies this paradox perfectly. It is the contingent form taken by the necessity of my contingency. I did not choose this particular flesh, these specific limitations, this concrete situation. Yet through this very body, I encounter the world and act upon it.

The body reveals itself most clearly through what I call coenesthetic affectivity - the pure non-positional apprehension of a colorless contingency. This is not emotion or sensation, but the raw fact of being embodied, of existing as a material presence in the world.

Language compounds this complexity. By revealing to us the major structures of our body-for-the-Other, language shows us how we appear from outside ourselves. We learn to see our own bodies as objects, as things that occupy space and follow physical laws.

**The Ground and Figure Structure**

When any object appears, it manifests against the ground of the world in a relation of externality with other phenomena. This formal structure between figure and ground is necessary. Nothing appears in isolation. Everything emerges from a background that gives it meaning.

Through objective laws, a strictly objective center of reference gets defined. But this center depends entirely on consciousness to establish it. Without the for-itself, there would be no perspective from which objects could appear as objects.

**Remaking the Self**

The freedom manifested through anguish carries a constantly renewed obligation. I must remake the Me through which I designate myself as a free being. This is not a one-time decision but an ongoing project.

Each moment demands that I choose who I am. Not just what I do, but how I understand what I do, what significance I assign to my actions, what future I project through my present choices.

**The Priority of Human Activity**

Even when the practico-inert seems to dominate us completely, the fundamental truth remains: human praxis created these structures in the first place. The priority of praxis over worked matter is the ground principle of all social existence.

We built the machines that now seem to control us. We established the economic systems that now constrain our choices. We created the institutions that now shape our possibilities.

This creation was not deliberate in every detail. Much of what we made exceeds our intentions. But it remains human creation nonetheless, the sedimented result of countless individual and collective actions.

**Genius and Creation**

Consider artistic creation. The genius of Proust is the works of Proust - not some mysterious inner quality, but the concrete achievement of specific texts. Proust became Proust by writing, by choosing words, by committing himself to particular projects.

This exemplifies the broader truth that existence precedes essence. Who you are - your essence - gets defined by what you do - your existence. Not the reverse.**The Concrete Reality of Choice**

I do not choose in a vacuum. My freedom operates within concrete situations, against specific resistances. The world presents itself as a totality of phenomena linked in networks of mutual reference, and I must navigate these connections.

When I act, objects appear against the ground of this world. They manifest themselves in relations of externality with other things that have already appeared. This formal structure between figure and ground is necessary - I cannot escape it.

**The Body as Contingent Necessity**

My body is the contingent form taken by the necessity of my contingency. Through it, objective laws define a strictly objective center of reference. I experience this through what I call coenesthetic affectivity - the pure non-positional apprehension of a colorless contingency.

This sounds abstract, but it describes something immediate. The dull ache in my stomach, the weight of fatigue, the restless energy that drives me forward - these are not mere physical sensations but the very texture of my situated freedom.

**Language and Recognition**

Language reveals to us the major structures of our body-for-the-Other. When I speak, I discover how others see me, how my freedom appears from the outside as a thing among things.

This creates a fundamental tension. I am simultaneously pure freedom and factical existence, consciousness and object, the one who chooses and the one who is chosen by circumstances.

**The Worker as Thing**

Nowhere is this clearer than in wage labor. As a wage laborer, the worker becomes a worked Thing. Human activity gets absorbed into the machinery of production, becomes subject to laws that seem external and inevitable.

Yet even here, the original creative power persists beneath the surface.
