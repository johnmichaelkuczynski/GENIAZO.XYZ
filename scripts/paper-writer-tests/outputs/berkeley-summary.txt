============================================================

In my philosophical endeavors, I have sought to illuminate the nature of reality through the lens of immaterialism. Central to my thesis is the assertion that the external world consists of ideas in God's mind. This perspective challenges the prevailing materialist view, which posits that material objects exist independently of perception. I contend that what we perceive as the external world is, in fact, a collection of ideas that exist only in the mind, and ultimately, in the divine mind of God.

To elucidate this thesis, I begin with the premise that the proper objects of sight are mental ideas. Our visual experiences are not direct interactions with physical objects but rather encounters with ideas that are presented to our minds. This understanding is grounded in my work, "An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision," where I argue that what we see are not material objects themselves but the ideas that represent them. These ideas are the true objects of perception, and they exist within the mind.

In advancing my thesis, I must emphasize the role of perception in understanding the world around us. The proper objects of sight, as I have argued, are not external material substances but rather mental ideas. This is a crucial point in my philosophy, as it underscores the notion that what we perceive are not physical objects themselves but the ideas that represent them in our minds.

Consider the nature of vision. When we see an object, such as a tree, we do not directly perceive the tree itself. Instead, we perceive the idea of the tree, which is a mental construct. This idea is not a mere shadow of the tree but the very essence of what we understand as the tree in our experience. The visible ideas, therefore, are the primary objects of sight, and they exist in the mind.

Furthermore, these visible ideas suggest tangible situations through learned association. Our experiences teach us to associate certain visual ideas with tactile experiences. For example, the sight of a flame suggests the sensation of heat, not because the flame itself possesses heat, but because we have learned to associate the idea of the flame with the idea of warmth. This association is not inherent in the objects themselves but is a product of our mental processes.

The implications of this perspective are profound. If the external world is composed of ideas in the mind, then the cause of our sensory ideas must also be a mind. I assert that this mind is none other than God. It is through God's perception that the ideas of the external world are sustained. Without God's constant perception, these ideas would cease to exist, for they have no independent reality outside of the mind.

This leads us to reject the notion of abstract matter unrealized in experience. The concept of matter existing independently of perception is, in my view, a fallacy. Matter, as traditionally conceived, is an abstraction that has no basis in our sensory experience. Instead, what we call matter is simply a collection of ideas perceived by the mind.

In conclusion, my philosophy of immaterialism posits that the external world is a construct of ideas in God's mind. The proper objects of sight are mental ideas, and these ideas suggest tangible situations through learned association. The cause of our sensory ideas is a divine mind, and the notion of matter independent of perception is untenable. By understanding the world as a collection of ideas, we come closer to grasping the true nature of reality, as it is sustained by the perception of God.This understanding dissolves many of the philosophical puzzles that have plagued thinkers for centuries. When we abandon the chimera of material substance, we eliminate the impossible problem of how mind and matter could ever interact. The skeptic's doubt about whether our ideas correspond to external objects vanishes entirely, for our ideas simply are the objects.

Consider how this applies to the study of nature itself. Science does not study some mysterious material substrate beneath appearances. Rather, science studies the connections and regularities among ideas themselves. When Newton describes the laws of motion, he maps the orderly patterns in which God presents ideas to finite minds like ours.

The real things of this world are distinguished not by some imaginary material foundation, but by their vividness, orderliness, and coherence. The ideas that constitute a genuine tree possess a stability and systematic character that mere figments of imagination lack. God's ideas follow consistent rules, creating the reliable natural order we observe.

My theory of vision demonstrates this principle clearly. Visual ideas function as a natural language, signifying tangible ideas through learned associations. When I see what appears to be a distant mountain, the visual idea contains no necessary reference to distance itself. Distance belongs to the tangible realm. Through experience, I have learned that certain visual signs predict certain tangible sensations when I attempt to walk or reach.

A person blind from birth possesses no ideas of light or color whatsoever. This proves that visible ideas and tangible ideas are specifically distinct. They are connected not by any inherent resemblance, but by the arbitrary associations we form through repeated experience. Visual ideas are signs for navigating the tangible world, much as words are signs for communicating thoughts.

This dissolves the puzzle of how we could ever perceive distance immediately. The ideas immediately present in vision contain no spatial information beyond what appears on the visual field itself. All judgments about three-dimensional space arise from learned connections between different sensory modalities.

Abstract general ideas, which philosophers have long struggled to explain, are impossible. I cannot form an idea that is simultaneously triangular and not triangular, large and small, red and not red. When I think generally about triangles, I employ a particular triangular idea as a representative, using it to stand for the entire class through the mediation of language.

An idea, being itself inactive, cannot resemble or represent an active thing. This strikes at the heart of materialist theories that suppose our ideas are copies of material originals. Activity belongs to minds alone. The supposed material world could never produce the ideas we experience, for matter lacks all power of action.

The external world consists entirely of ideas in God's infinite mind. We finite spirits perceive portions of this divine ideational realm according to the laws God has established. This is true realism - not the false realism that posits unknowable material substances, but the recognition that our experienced world has genuine objective reality as the very thoughts of God.Real things are those vivid, orderly, and coherent ideas that God impresses upon our minds according to stable laws. The regularity we observe in nature reflects the consistency of the divine will, not the operation of mindless matter. When I see the sun rise each morning, I witness God's faithful adherence to the patterns He has established for our experience.

Science studies the connections and regularities among ideas, not the behavior of material substances. Newton's laws describe how visual and tactile ideas succeed one another in our experience. The mathematician traces relationships between the ideas God presents to us. This makes scientific knowledge both possible and meaningful, grounded in the eternal stability of the divine mind.

The cause of our sensory ideas must be a mind, for only minds possess the power to produce ideas. Material substance, even if it existed, could never bridge the gap between its supposed motions and the ideas we actually experience. How could the collision of atoms generate the taste of honey or the sound of music? The very notion is absurd.

Immaterialism dissolves the philosophical puzzles that have tormented thinkers for centuries. How does the soul interact with the body? There is no material body - only ideas of embodiment that God coordinates with our volitions. How do we know the external world exists? We know it because we directly perceive God's ideas, not because we infer it from mental copies. How can finite minds grasp infinite truths? We participate in the divine understanding through the ideas God shares with us.

My doctrine rescues philosophy from the endless pursuits it has engaged in while chasing material phantoms. The skeptic who doubts the existence of sensible things doubts what he immediately perceives. But ideas cannot be doubted by the mind that has them. I am more certain of the idea of blue I now experience than of any supposed material cause behind it.

A person blind from birth has no ideas of light or color, proving that visual ideas are not innate but arise from God's direct action upon our minds. The blind person navigates by touch and hearing - different channels through which the divine mind communicates spatial relationships. Each sense provides its own distinct language for interpreting God's world.

Visual ideas function as a natural language signifying tangible situations. Just as arbitrary words gain meaning through convention, visual signs acquire significance through divine appointment and our learned responses. The small visual appearance that signifies a distant mountain operates exactly like a word that signifies a concept - through established connection, not natural resemblance.

This understanding transforms our relationship with the sensible world. We no longer seek material causes behind appearances but read the divine communications presented to our senses. Nature becomes God's visual language, speaking directly to created minds.The materialist philosopher stumbles over problems that dissolve instantly under my principles. How does matter act upon mind? The question becomes meaningless when we recognize that only minds can act. How do we know external objects exist? We know them as surely as we know our own ideas, for they are ideas in the infinite mind of God.

Consider the regularity of natural phenomena. The materialist must explain how dead matter produces consistent laws. But laws exist only in minds that comprehend them. The uniformity of nature reflects the constancy of divine will, not the mechanical operations of senseless particles.

My immaterialism explains what materialism cannot. Why do sensible qualities appear exactly as they do? Because God chooses to present them thus to our minds. Why do objects maintain their properties when unperceived by us? Because they continue existing as ideas in God's eternal consciousness.

The scientist studying nature examines the connections and regularities among ideas, not material substances. When Newton discovers gravitational attraction, he maps the consistent relationships between visual and tangible ideas. His laws describe how God coordinates our experiences, not how matter moves through absolute space.

Abstract general ideas, which philosophers invoke to explain knowledge, prove impossible upon examination. I cannot form an idea of triangle in general - neither equilateral nor scalene, neither large nor small, yet somehow all triangles at once. Such contradictory notions exist only in words, not in any mind's actual conception.

What we call general ideas are particular ideas made representative through language. The word "triangle" makes any particular triangular idea stand for all triangles through conventional usage. This dissolves the ancient puzzle of universals without multiplying mysterious abstract entities.

Real things distinguish themselves from imaginary ones through their vividness, orderliness, and coherence. The ideas composing this room appear more vivid and stable than my fleeting fantasies. But both real and imaginary ideas exist only in minds - the difference lies in their source and systematic character.

My philosophy requires no violent departures from common sense. The vulgar believe in houses and trees, and so do I. They believe these things exist independently of their own minds, and so do I - they exist in God's mind. The materialist philosopher alone denies the plain evidence of sense by interposing unknowable substances behind appearances.

I acknowledge my debt to philosophers who preceded me. Though they did not reach the desired port, their wrecks have marked the rocks and sands, making passage safer for those who follow. Locke's insights into ideas, despite his errors about abstraction, cleared much ground. Malebranche's recognition that we see all things in God approached the truth, though he retained unnecessary material scaffolding.

The cause of our sensory ideas must be a mind, for only minds possess the power to produce ideas in other minds.Matter cannot cause ideas because it lacks the essential quality of activity. An idea, being itself passive, cannot resemble or represent an active substance. Only spirit possesses genuine causal power.

God's mind contains the archetypal ideas that constitute the natural world. When I perceive a tree, I participate in God's idea of that tree. The regularity and universality of natural phenomena reflect the constancy of the divine intellect, not the operations of brute matter.

This explains why natural laws hold universally. Fire burns and water flows because God's ideas maintain consistent patterns. Science studies these divine regularities, not the imaginary interactions of material particles. Newton's mathematical descriptions capture the orderly connections among God's ideas with admirable precision.

My immaterialism dissolves countless philosophical puzzles that have tormented thinkers for centuries. How does mind interact with matter? There is no matter. How do we know external objects resemble our ideas? Objects are ideas. How can material things be divided infinitely? They cannot, for ideas have no spatial extension independent of perception.

The doctrine of abstract general ideas creates artificial difficulties. Locke claims we can form an idea of triangle that is simultaneously equilateral and scalene, acute and obtuse. Such contradictory notions cannot exist in any mind. I hold there are general ideas, but they are particular ideas made general through their representative function, not through impossible abstraction.

Visual and tangible ideas are specifically distinct, connected only through learned associations. The person born blind has no ideas of light or color, proving these are not inherent to spatial perception. Visual ideas function as a natural language, signifying tangible situations through divine appointment.

Distance itself is not immediately visible. The ideas present in vision contain no necessary reference to spatial extension. We judge distances through associated tangible experiences, not through direct visual perception. This dissolves the puzzle of how we see three-dimensional space through two-dimensional retinal images.

Scripture and rational demonstration converge on immaterialism. Moses teaches that God spoke the world into existence - what clearer statement that reality consists in divine ideas? The immediate presence of God in all our perceptions makes prayer and providence intelligible rather than mysterious.

My philosophy recommends itself through its native evidence and practical consequences. It makes the existence of God demonstrably certain rather than merely probable. It shows divine providence operating immediately in every moment of experience. It dissolves skeptical doubts by removing the veil of material substance that hides reality from knowledge.

The external world consists entirely of ideas in God's mind, perceived by finite spirits according to divine appointment. This spiritual universe requires no unknowable substrates or impossible abstractions. Reality lies open to direct inspection by minds capable of receiving divine illumination.Real things are those vivid, orderly, and coherent ideas that God impresses upon us with regularity. Dreams and fantasies lack this divine consistency. The cause of our sensory ideas must be a mind - matter being passive cannot produce active perception.

Science studies the connections and regularities among ideas, not material causes. Newton's laws describe the divine grammar by which God speaks the natural world. Mathematical relations express the eternal thoughts of the supreme intellect made manifest in temporal experience.

An idea being itself inactive cannot resemble an active thing. This destroys the resemblance theory that supposes material objects cause ideas by copying themselves in consciousness. Only spirit acts - matter, if it existed, could only suffer.

Immaterialism dissolves philosophical puzzles that have tormented thinkers for centuries. The mind-body problem vanishes when we recognize that bodies are collections of ideas. The problem of external world skepticism disappears when we see that ideas are the only reality we ever encounter.
