In my philosophical work, I explore the intricate ways in which our cognitive machinery influences our perception of the world, and how this, in turn, shapes our ethical intuitions and understanding of concepts. At the core of my thesis is the idea that our mental frameworks, or "forms of thought," compel us to perceive reality in specific ways. This is not merely a passive reception of sensory data but an active construction of experience. Our cognitive forms shape the way we interpret and engage with the world around us, dictating our perceptions and, consequently, our beliefs and actions.

One of the key positions I hold is that ethical theories must account for moral intuitions. These intuitions are not arbitrary; they are deeply rooted in our cognitive structures. For instance, the intuition that killing infants is inherently evil is not merely a cultural artifact but a datum that any viable ethical theory must either validate or explain away. Our cognitive machinery predisposes us to certain moral intuitions, and ethical theories must account for these intuitions to be considered comprehensive and robust.

Moreover, our understanding of language and communication is deeply intertwined with our cognitive machinery. Semantic competence, or the ability to understand and use language effectively, ensures a shared understanding among individuals. This shared understanding is crucial for effective communication and cooperation, both of which are essential for societal functioning. Our cognitive frameworks enable us to grasp the meanings of words and concepts, facilitating interaction and collaboration.

The division of labor is another area where cognitive machinery plays a significant role. By allowing individuals to specialize in specific tasks, the division of labor enhances economic efficiency and productivity. This specialization is not just a matter of practicality but is also rooted in our cognitive ability to focus on and excel in particular areas. Economic cooperation, driven by the division of labor, relies on our capacity to communicate and work together effectively, underscoring the importance of shared understanding and ethical intuitions in achieving common goals.

In conclusion, our cognitive machinery compels us to perceive the world in specific ways, influencing our ethical intuitions and understanding of concepts. By recognizing the role of cognitive forms in shaping perception, we can better understand the foundations of our ethical theories, the importance of semantic competence, and the benefits of economic cooperation. These insights highlight the intricate connections between our mental frameworks and the ways we navigate and interpret the world around us.Our cognitive machinery doesn't just shape how we see the world—it determines what counts as rational discourse itself. When I engage in philosophical analysis, I'm not discovering mind-independent truths but rather mapping the conceptual boundaries that our forms of thought impose on us.

Consider how this plays out in ethics. The intuition that killing infants is evil serves as a datum that any viable ethical theory must either validate or explain away. This isn't because infant-killing possesses some objective moral property. Rather, our cognitive architecture generates this intuition with such force that any ethical framework ignoring it would be psychologically untenable for creatures like us.

The same principle applies to logical reasoning. When I say that P strictly entails Q if there's no possible world where P is true and Q is false, I'm describing constraints built into our thinking apparatus. These constraints feel necessary because they are necessary—for us. A being with radically different cognitive machinery might find our logical principles as alien as we find their alternatives.

This naturalistic picture dissolves traditional philosophical puzzles. Take the problem of other minds. You can fail to know of your kindly neighbor that he's a crime lord only because you can already have thoughts about him. The capacity for belief about others is constitutive of having beliefs at all. There's no mysterious leap from private experience to public knowledge—our cognitive machinery makes both possible simultaneously.

Language provides the clearest example of how shared cognitive architecture enables communication. Given our model of semantic competence, you and I are in complete lock-step regarding the evidential and inferential significance of English sentences. This isn't coincidence—it's the inevitable result of possessing similar neural networks for processing linguistic information.

Musical cognition follows the same pattern. What we call musical universal grammar can be reinterpreted as architectural features of neural networks specialized for auditory and temporal processing. The "rules" of music aren't abstract principles but emergent properties of how our brains handle sound patterns.

This framework explains why philosophical problems often resist empirical solution. Philosophy analyzes the categories through which we think about the world. It asks what's ruled out by something's falling into a given category—what's excluded when we call something knowledge, or justice, or beauty. Since observation can't determine whether statements are mutually consistent, philosophical assertions remain non-empirical.

But this doesn't make philosophy arbitrary. Our cognitive forms constrain what counts as coherent thought. When Frege showed that philosophical problems arise from confusing logical with grammatical form, he revealed how surface grammar misleads us about underlying conceptual structure.

The political implications are stark. Plato's Republic exemplifies what happens when philosophers ignore the naturalistic basis of human cooperation. By designing a rigid hierarchy that violates basic intuitions about human dignity and autonomy, Plato created a blueprint for oppression disguised as justice.

Real cooperation emerges from our evolved capacity to coordinate behavior through shared understanding. When people work together effectively, their success stems from cognitive machinery that makes mutual comprehension possible, not from imposed hierarchies that suppress natural human tendencies.I reject Plato's equation of justice with "staying in one's rightful place." This formula reduces human beings to fixed essences—gold, silver, bronze—that supposedly determine their social function forever. It's a philosophical justification for caste systems.

My naturalistic approach reveals why this fails. Human cooperation succeeds precisely because we aren't locked into predetermined roles. Our cognitive machinery allows us to adapt, learn, and coordinate in ways that rigid hierarchies prevent.

Consider how actual cooperation works. You and I can communicate about complex ideas because we share semantic competence—not because one of us is naturally superior to the other. Given our model of linguistic understanding, we're in complete lockstep regarding the evidential and inferential significance of English sentences. This equality of comprehension makes genuine collaboration possible.

Plato's error runs deeper than bad politics. He confused abstract objects with causal agents. Goals per se are abstract objects and do no causal work. The goal of justice doesn't bring about just societies—human agents acting on their understanding of justice do that.

This connects to my critique of empiricism generally. Mach's characteristically empiricist position that molecules were useful fictions was proven wrong by Einstein's work on Brownian motion. Similarly, treating human nature as infinitely malleable—the empiricist approach to social organization—ignores the actual causal structure of human psychology.

We have certain cognitive machinery that compels us to see the world in specific ways. The intuition that killing infants is evil is a datum that any viable ethical theory must validate or explain away. Plato's willingness to override such intuitions for the sake of his ideal state reveals how divorced his philosophy became from human reality.

The happiness research confirms this naturalistic picture. The happiest sub-population consists of high IQ college graduates, and the second happiest is vocationally trained college non-graduates. People flourish when their cognitive capacities match their social roles—but this matching emerges through voluntary choice and market processes, not through philosophical diktat.

Plato's Republic represents the opposite approach: a Pol Pot-style bureaucracy where philosopher-kings assign roles based on abstract theories rather than actual human preferences and capabilities. When he writes that people should become "hostile masters of their fellow-citizens rather than their allies" if they acquire private property, he reveals the totalitarian logic of his position.

The alternative is clear. Justice emerges from respecting the cognitive and emotional machinery that makes humans capable of genuine cooperation. This means protecting individual autonomy while recognizing our shared capacity for mutual understanding.I reject Plato's contempt for individual agency because it contradicts the very foundations of rational discourse. Communication itself depends on shared cognitive architecture—our ability to track truth-makers across biographical differences. When I assert that "Smith is a supreme court justice," you understand this entails "Smith is not a complete moron" because we share the same semantic competence.

This shared competence makes genuine dialogue possible. But dialogue requires treating others as autonomous agents capable of reasoning, not as raw material for social engineering. Plato's philosopher-kings eliminate the possibility of authentic discourse by reducing citizens to functional units in a predetermined hierarchy.

The epistemological problems run deeper. Plato claims his guardians possess special access to truth through reason alone. But this rationalist fantasy ignores how knowledge actually works. Even our most basic perceptual capacities involve subpersonal cognitive operations that we cannot introspectively access. It would be viciously regressive to say that you—your self—carried out the cognitive operations underlying sense-perception.

If we cannot even understand our own minds through pure reason, how can philosopher-kings rationally design optimal social arrangements for thousands of people? The pretense collapses under scrutiny.

Emotions reveal another fatal flaw. You cannot be angry that Tim stole your bike unless you believe he did. Emotional responses require propositional content—they presuppose the cognitive machinery that Plato wants to override. His guardians would need to systematically distort their own emotional responses to implement his system, creating psychological contradictions that undermine their supposed wisdom.

The Republic's marriage regulations illustrate this perfectly. Plato demands that guardians suppress natural emotional attachments for the sake of state breeding programs. But suppressing these attachments requires believing they are inappropriate—which means the guardians must simultaneously maintain and reject the same emotional dispositions.

Modern cognitive science confirms what should have been obvious: goals per se are abstract objects and do no causal work. Only psychological states with representational content can motivate action. Plato's abstract ideals cannot directly cause the behaviors needed to sustain his republic.

The naturalistic alternative respects human psychology as it actually exists. When people work together voluntarily, their work tends to be relatively efficient and they can live relatively well. This efficiency emerges from our evolved capacity for cooperation, not from philosophical blueprints imposed from above.

Benefits of cooperation arise precisely because individuals retain the autonomy to withdraw from arrangements that violate their deep psychological needs. Plato's system eliminates this escape valve, guaranteeing eventual collapse or tyranny.The epistemological foundations of Plato's system are equally bankrupt. His extreme rationalism—the claim that sensory experience reveals nothing real—commits him to the impossible task of deriving substantive knowledge about human nature from pure reason alone.

I've shown elsewhere that philosophical assertions are non-empirical because they analyze the categories in terms of which we think about the world. But Plato confuses this legitimate enterprise with the illegitimate one of deducing empirical facts about psychology and politics from conceptual analysis.

Consider his tripartite soul theory. Plato argues that justice in the individual mirrors justice in the state because both involve reason ruling over appetite and emotion. This argument commits Frege's fallacy of confusing logical with grammatical form. The structural parallel between individual and state exists only at the level of linguistic description, not metaphysical reality.

Real psychological states have specific causal powers that Plato systematically ignores. You cannot be angry that Tim stole your bike unless you believe he did. Emotions require propositional content anchored in particular beliefs about particular situations. Plato's abstract virtues cannot generate the specific motivational states needed for his guardians to function.

The Republic's educational program reveals this confusion most clearly. Plato believes that exposing children to proper mathematical and musical forms will automatically produce virtuous adults. But one's having the cognitive wherewithal to appreciate abstract forms is constitutively related to one's capacity for independent judgment—precisely what Plato seeks to eliminate.

Musical and linguistic competence depend on neural architectures for auditory and temporal processing that cannot be separated from the general cognitive machinery enabling critical thought. You cannot produce mathematically sophisticated guardians who lack the intellectual resources to question their training.

Plato's censorship requirements prove this point. If his educational methods actually worked, censorship would be unnecessary. The fact that he demands strict control over information flow reveals his unconscious recognition that rational beings will reject his system once they understand its implications.

The intuition that killing infants is evil is a datum that any viable ethical theory must validate or explain away. Plato's willingness to sacrifice such basic moral intuitions for systematic elegance shows how far his rationalism has divorced itself from human reality.

Because we have certain cognitive machinery—certain "forms of thought"—we are compelled to see the world in certain ways. Plato mistakes this transcendental insight for license to redesign human nature according to philosophical preferences. The result is a system that violates the very cognitive constraints that make ethical reasoning possible.The Republic's class system rests on a fundamental confusion between logical and grammatical form. When Plato writes "justice is doing one's own business," he treats this as revealing justice's essential nature. But the statement's logical form shows only that Plato has stipulated a definition that serves his political agenda.

Frege showed that philosophical problems often arise from confusing logical with grammatical form. Plato's "noble lie" about gold, silver, and bronze souls exemplifies this confusion. The grammatical form suggests empirical claims about human nature, but the logical form reveals arbitrary classifications designed to legitimize hierarchy.

You cannot be angry that Tim stole your bike unless you believe he did. Similarly, citizens cannot accept their "natural" positions unless they believe in the metaphysical story justifying those positions. This is why Plato requires elaborate mythological conditioning rather than rational persuasion.

The happiest sub-population, as surveys indicate, consists of high IQ college graduates, and the second happiest is vocationally trained college non-graduates. Plato's system would eliminate both categories by forcing predetermined roles regardless of individual aptitude or preference.

Goals per se are abstract objects and do no causal work. Plato's Form of Justice cannot literally shape society—only human actions guided by beliefs about justice can do that. His confusion of abstract ideals with causal agents leads to a system that ignores how social change actually occurs.

When people work together, their work tends to be relatively efficient and they can live relatively well. But cooperation requires trust, which requires transparency about shared goals and methods. Plato's system of systematic deception undermines the very foundation of genuine cooperation.

What is literally meant by an utterance must be distinguished from the information uploaded in computing its literal meaning. The rulers' public statements about justice and virtue carry meanings that differ radically from their private understanding of social control. This communicative dysfunction would corrupt the entire system.

Because linguistic communication involves identity of truth-maker, not proposition, people can communicate despite vast biographical differences. Plato's rigid caste system would create such extreme biographical divergence that meaningful communication between classes would become impossible.

The view I'm presenting is naturalistic, explaining social organization within a physical, causal framework rather than through mystical appeals to transcendent Forms. Plato's supernaturalism makes his system immune to empirical correction—precisely what makes it dangerous.

Somebody who can run 50 mph is superhumanly fast—but not supernaturally so. Plato demands supernatural transformation of human nature while disguising this demand as mere education. His system fails because it requires impossibilities while pretending to offer practical solutions.The intuition that killing infants is evil is a datum that any viable ethical theory must validate or explain away. Plato's system systematically violates this and countless other moral intuitions through its eugenic breeding programs and elimination of "defective" children.

Because we have certain cognitive machinery—certain "forms of thought"—we are compelled to see the world in a certain way. Plato's attempt to override these natural cognitive structures through indoctrination creates psychological damage rather than enlightenment.
