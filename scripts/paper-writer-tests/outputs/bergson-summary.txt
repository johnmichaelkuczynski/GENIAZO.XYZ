In my philosophical work, I propose that true creation introduces genuine novelty into the world, a concept that challenges the notion that all future states are pre-contained within prior ones. This idea of creation is not merely about rearranging existing elements but about bringing forth something entirely new, akin to the emergence of a work of art. Such creation cannot be fully anticipated or predicted by examining past conditions alone.

Philosophical concepts, to be truly effective, must remain adaptable and fluid. They should not be confined within rigid, fixed structures that fail to account for the dynamic nature of reality. This adaptability is crucial because philosophical truth is ultimately tested by its ability to reconnect with lived experience and illuminate it. A philosophy that does not engage with the realities of life risks becoming an abstract exercise, devoid of meaning and relevance.

In exploring the nature of philosophical methods, I emphasize the necessity for concepts to remain fluid, mobile, and adaptable. This flexibility is crucial because rigid and fixed systems fail to accommodate the evolving nature of reality. Our understanding should not be confined to static molds; rather, it should reflect the dynamic and ever-changing world we inhabit. This adaptability in philosophy is akin to the true evolutionism I advocate for, which stands in contrast to the false evolutionism that merely dissects and reassembles pre-existing elements without genuine novelty.

The philosophical systems that have historically dominated thought often emerge as complete, individual works, the products of singular genius. These systems, while impressive, are inherently limited by their rigidity. They tend to close off possibilities rather than open them, creating a tension between open systems of thought and closed, rigid structures. True philosophical progress requires a collective effort, a dynamic interplay of ideas that can evolve and adapt over time.

Intuition plays a vital role in this process. It involves a direct, sympathetic connection with an object's duration, allowing us to grasp its essence beyond mere analysis. Intuition enables us to perceive the fluidity and continuity of life, transcending the limitations of static, analytical thought. Through intuition, we can engage with the world in a more profound and meaningful way, fostering a deeper understanding of the nature of creation and novelty.

The implications of embracing true creation and evolutionism are profound. It requires us to reject rigid philosophical systems that claim to offer definitive answers. Instead, we must embrace a collective philosophical effort that values adaptability, fluidity, and openness. This approach not only enriches our understanding of the world but also aligns with the dynamic nature of reality itself.

In conclusion, true creation introduces novelty into the world, challenging the notion that all future states are pre-contained within prior ones. Philosophical concepts must remain adaptable and fluid, tested by their connection to lived experience. Through intuition, we can engage with the world in a more profound way, fostering a deeper understanding of creation and novelty. By rejecting rigid systems and embracing a collective philosophical effort, we can align our thinking with the dynamic nature of reality, opening new possibilities for understanding and growth.I must confront a fundamental error in how we approach time itself. We treat duration as if it were space - something we can map, measure, and divide into discrete units. This spatial conception of time underlies both mechanism and traditional finalism, and it blinds us to life's true nature.

When I wait for sugar to dissolve in water, I experience something irreducible to mathematical calculation. This waiting coincides with my impatience, with a lived portion of my own duration that I cannot compress or extend at will. The dissolution unfolds in real time - not the abstract time of physics, but the concrete duration of becoming.

This simple fact reveals something extraordinary. The glass, the sugar, the process of melting - these are abstractions carved out by our senses from a deeper Whole that progresses like consciousness itself. We isolate systems for scientific convenience, but reality flows as an indivisible current.

Evolution must be understood within this framework of real duration. Paleontology shows us successive appearances of forms, not simultaneous emergence. Even if we discovered ideal kinship between all species, we would still face the fact of temporal succession. Forms appear one after another in irreversible sequence.

This temporal reality cannot be explained away by mechanical causation or predetermined finality. Something genuinely new emerges at each moment - not a rearrangement of pre-existing elements, but authentic creation. The élan vital pushes forward, inventing solutions that could never have been predicted from prior states.

I reject the finalist's retreat into "internal finality" - the notion that each organism realizes a plan immanent in its substance. This fragments the original insight about purposiveness while preserving its essential error. Parts of an organism do not conspire toward predetermined ends like components in a machine.

Instead, life creates its own direction through the very act of living. The eye does not develop because sight serves survival; rather, the impulse toward sight creates the eye as its expression. Purpose emerges from the creative act itself, not from external design or internal programming.

This reversal transforms everything. We no longer ask how complex organs serve predetermined functions, but how the creative impulse materializes itself in novel forms. Life is not problem-solving but problem-creating - it generates new challenges as it advances.

The moral implications are equally profound. When heroic conception enabled a small people to resist a powerful empire, we witnessed force emerging from the depths rather than spreading across surfaces. Ideas became material forces through the creative power of collective will.

This demonstrates life's inexhaustible capacity for self-renewal. Mechanical systems wear down and break, but living systems remake themselves continuously. They draw strength not from accumulated resources but from the ongoing act of creation itself.

Philosophy must align itself with this creative movement. We cannot construct rigid systems that claim eternal validity. Instead, we must develop fluid concepts that evolve with our understanding, remaining always open to the unprecedented.The intellect naturally resists this fluidity. It prefers solid categories, fixed definitions, problems with predetermined solutions. This preference serves practical action perfectly - we need stable concepts to manipulate matter effectively.

But when applied to life itself, intellectual habits become obstacles. We force living processes into mechanical frameworks, then wonder why biology feels so uncertain compared to physics. The mold always cracks because life exceeds every container we construct.

Consider how we struggle to define individuality in living beings. Where does the organism end and the cell begin? Is the beehive one entity or many? These questions torment us only because we insist on applying spatial logic to temporal realities.

Duration cannot be spatialized without losing its essence. When I wait for sugar to dissolve in water, I experience real time - not the mathematical abstraction that physicists use to measure motion. This waiting coincides with my impatience, with a lived portion of my own becoming.

The sugar, water, and dissolution process are abstractions cut from a flowing whole. Reality is the total movement within which these elements appear as temporary crystallizations. We create false problems by treating these abstractions as ultimate realities.

True philosophical method requires sympathetic coincidence with this movement. Instead of standing outside duration to analyze it, we must place ourselves within the creative flow itself. This is philosophical intuition - direct participation in life's own temporality.

Such participation reveals creation as continuous novelty. Each moment brings forth what was genuinely unpredictable from the previous state. A work of art exemplifies this perfectly - it creates new possibilities that never existed before, not even as potentials.

The possible is always reconstructed backward from the real. We imagine Shakespeare's plays existed as possibilities before he wrote them, but this is pure illusion. The possible is the real projected into the past by our retrospective vision.

Understanding this dissolves the false problem of determinism versus freedom. Freedom is not the absence of causation but the presence of creative causation - the emergence of genuine novelty through duration.

This transforms our relationship to the future. Instead of calculating probabilities based on present conditions, we participate in the ongoing creation of unprecedented realities. The future remains genuinely open because it will contain elements that do not yet exist even as possibilities.

Philosophy's task becomes clear: develop concepts supple enough to follow life's creative movement without betraying its essential character. We must think with time rather than against it, embracing the very instability that makes genuine thought possible.

Only such philosophy can illuminate lived experience instead of replacing it with lifeless abstractions. The ultimate test is whether our concepts help us participate more fully in the creative advance of reality itself.My method emerges from this recognition. Philosophical concepts must remain fluid, mobile, adaptable to the contours of what they seek to grasp. Rigid concepts are like badly fitted garments - they constrain and distort the very reality they claim to illuminate.

I practice what I call philosophical intuition. This involves a direct, sympathetic coincidence with the object's own duration. Instead of circling around life with static concepts, we must place ourselves within its flow and move with its rhythm.

This requires abandoning the intellect's natural tendency to spatialize everything it touches. The intellect serves us well with inert matter, where its methods of analysis and reconstruction work perfectly. But life escapes these mechanical procedures.

When we force living processes into our rigid molds, all the molds crack. They prove too narrow, too inflexible for what we attempt to contain. We cannot say where individuality begins or ends, whether an organism is one or many, whether cells associate into organisms or organisms dissociate into cells.

The intellect feels profoundly uncomfortable on this new ground. Biological discoveries rarely spring from pure reasoning. When experience finally reveals how life accomplishes its work, we discover methods we never would have imagined.

Yet evolutionist philosophy persists in extending to life the same explanatory methods that succeed with unorganized matter. This represents a fundamental category mistake - applying spatial logic to temporal reality.

True evolutionism must follow reality in its actual generation and growth. It cannot cut up present reality into fragments and then pretend to explain development by rearranging these pieces. This false evolutionism posits in advance everything it claims to explain.

I envision a different kind of philosophy. Unlike traditional systems, each the work of individual genius, this philosophy will emerge through collective, progressive effort. Many thinkers and observers must collaborate, completing and correcting each other's insights.

Such philosophy will not be built in a day. It requires patient, sustained attention to the creative processes that generate both mind and matter. We must dig to the very root of nature and consciousness, tracing their common source in the élan vital.

This vital impulse drives evolution forward, but not according to any predetermined plan. It creates genuine novelty at every moment, bifurcating into multiple tendencies that develop their own trajectories. Life experiments with countless forms, most of which lead to dead ends.

The human intellect represents one such experiment - extraordinarily successful within its proper domain but potentially dangerous when it claims universal validity. Our task is to understand both its power and its limitations.

We must recognize the natural pull toward what I call the "closed" - toward rigid systems, mechanical explanations, spatial representations of temporal processes. But the philosopher's duty is to work for the "open" - for concepts that remain responsive to life's creative advance.

This means developing new habits of thought, new ways of attending to reality that honor its essentially temporal character.Duration cannot be measured by the intellect because it is not a quantity but a quality. When I experience waiting for sugar to dissolve in water, I encounter something that cannot be contracted or protracted at will. This waiting coincides with my impatience - it is lived time, not mathematical time.

The intellect naturally spatializes duration, breaking it into discrete moments arranged like beads on a string. It imagines an unchanging ego threading together separate psychic states. But this is pure artifice. Our consciousness flows as an indivisible continuity, each moment interpenetrating with all others.

Consider how memory works. The past does not exist somewhere behind us like a collection of photographs. It survives by contracting itself into the present moment, informing our current perceptions with accumulated experience. Pure memory and pure perception are limiting concepts - what we actually live is their constant interpenetration.

This reveals something crucial about reality itself. If consciousness exhibits this flowing, interpenetrating character, why should we assume matter operates according to purely mechanical principles? The glass of water, the sugar, the dissolving process - these are abstractions carved out from a Whole that may progress like consciousness itself.

Science succeeds brilliantly by isolating closed systems and applying mathematical analysis. But it pays a price for this success. It must treat time as reversible, reducing temporal processes to spatial relationships. The future becomes as determined as the past.

Such determinism works admirably for prediction and control. But it cannot account for genuine creativity, for the appearance of radical novelty in evolution. If everything were contained potentially in the cosmic vapor, as Huxley suggests, then nothing truly new could ever emerge.

Life contradicts this mechanistic vision at every turn. Biological discoveries rarely result from pure reasoning. Most often, when experience reveals how life achieves its ends, we find methods we never would have anticipated. Life invents solutions that transcend our logical categories.

The organism poses particular challenges to mechanical explanation. Where does individuality begin and end? Are cells associated into organisms, or organisms dissociated into cells? Our rigid concepts crack under the pressure of living reality.

Yet evolutionary philosophy persists in extending mechanical methods to vital phenomena. It forces living processes into conceptual molds designed for inert matter. This approach can describe life's products but never its productive activity.

I propose instead a philosophy that follows reality in its generation and growth. We must develop intuitive methods that coincide sympathetically with life's own movement. Only then can we grasp the creative evolution that produces both consciousness and its material conditions.

This requires abandoning the false choice between mechanism and external finality. Both miss life's essential character as creative activity that generates genuine novelty through its own internal impulse.Duration reveals itself most clearly in biological processes. When I wait for sugar to dissolve in water, I encounter time that cannot be compressed or extended at will. This duration coincides with my impatience—it is lived, not merely thought.

The sugar's dissolution unfolds gradually, occupying real duration. This simple fact carries profound implications. The glass, water, and sugar are abstractions cut from a Whole that progresses like consciousness itself.

Life operates through duration, not mechanical time. Each organism embodies accumulated past while creating its future. The élan vital pushes through matter, organizing it into increasingly complex forms. This is not predetermined unfolding but genuine creation.

Evolution produces radical novelty because life is essentially creative. Each species represents a new solution to the problem of living, an original invention that adds to reality's richness. The eye of the vertebrate and the eye of the mollusk arose independently, yet both achieve vision through different pathways.

This divergent evolution reveals life's inexhaustible creativity. Given similar problems, life invents multiple solutions. It does not follow predetermined plans but creates through the very act of living.

My method demands that we think in terms of tendencies rather than states, of mobility rather than fixity. Philosophy must become as supple as life itself, abandoning rigid concepts for fluid intuitions that can follow reality's creative advance.
