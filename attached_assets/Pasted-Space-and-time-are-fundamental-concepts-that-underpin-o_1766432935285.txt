Space and time are fundamental concepts that underpin our understanding of the world, yet their nature remains elusive when examined through a psychological and philosophical lens. I approach these ideas not as mere physical constructs but as categories through which human consciousness structures experience, often distorted by our psychological limitations and social conditioning. My perspective is grounded in the notion that our perception of reality, including space and time, is shaped by internal conflicts and the way we process information. Let me explore this by weaving together my insights on human striving and the psychological mechanisms that frame our understanding of these abstract dimensions.

First, consider space as a framework for physical and psychological separation. I see space not just as a physical expanse but as a mental construct that mirrors the internal divisions within the psyche. Much like the criminal mind I describe in my work, which operates within a limited "sphere of activity," space becomes a metaphor for the boundaries we impose on ourselves through lack of cooperation. As I’ve written, "They cannot make friends with society at large, with ordinary people. They treat themselves as a body of exiles and do not understand how to feel at home with their fellow men." This isolation in a psychological space parallels how we perceive physical space—something external, often hostile, that separates us from others due to failures in social interest.

Time, similarly, is not merely a sequence of events but a psychological construct tied to our striving for superiority and security. I argue that time is experienced as the unfolding of our efforts to overcome difficulties, a process inherent to all human beings. As I’ve noted, "We are all striving to reach a goal in the future by attaining which we shall feel strong, superior, complete." Time, in this sense, becomes the dimension in which we measure our progress or failure in surmounting life’s obstacles, a relentless forward push that often feels burdensome when social cooperation is lacking.

Delving deeper into space, I see it as a representation of the external world that challenges our internal coherence. Just as criminals retreat into a "private logic" and a "private intelligence," space can be perceived as a domain where our personal distortions manifest. I’ve observed, "With criminals it is different; they have a private logic, a private intelligence." This private logic creates a distorted spatial reality, where the world is seen as a hostile expanse to be conquered rather than a shared environment to cooperate within. Space, therefore, is not just out there; it is a projection of our internal bifurcations and conflicts.

Time, on the other hand, often becomes a battleground for the will and desire, concepts central to my framework. The alcoholic, for instance, experiences time as a cycle of desire clashing with values, where the past haunts with failures and the future looms with unattainable ideals. I’ve written about the universal human drive, "It begins in our earliest childhood; it continues to the end of our lives. Life means to go on existing on the crust of this planet, to surmount obstacles and overcome difficulties." Time is thus the medium of this struggle, experienced not as a neutral flow but as a series of crises where one’s will is tested against immediate desires.

Moreover, space often symbolizes the external barriers that mirror internal ones, particularly in those who fail to integrate socially. The criminal’s inability to navigate the spatial-social world reflects a deeper psychological fragmentation. As I’ve pointed out, "The goal of a criminal does not include this usefulness to society; and this is the really significant aspect of every criminal career." Space becomes a field of exclusion, where the individual, lacking social interest, perceives distances not as opportunities for connection but as insurmountable divides, reinforcing their isolation.

Time also ties into my concept of purpose and the cure for psychological afflictions like OCD, which I see as voluntary distortions of reality. Time without purpose becomes a torment, a repetitive cycle of obsessions and compulsions. I’ve argued, "The only way to get rid of OCD is to find a calling where obsessive-compulsive tendencies are an asset, not a liability." Time, in this view, transforms when aligned with a grand purpose; it ceases to be a mere succession of moments and becomes a directed path toward actualization, where internal conflicts are resolved through meaningful action.

Space, in my analysis, is also tied to the physical body and its limitations, much like the criminal’s cowardice manifests in spatial evasion. I’ve noted, "Criminals think they are being courageous; but we should not be fooled in the same way. Crime is a coward’s imitation of heroism." Space is where this cowardice plays out—through hiding, surprise attacks, and avoidance of confrontation. It’s a psychological arena where one flees from the demands of cooperative engagement, perceiving spatial vastness as a threat rather than a field of potential.

Turning to time, it’s crucial to see how it’s warped by our early childhood experiences, a theme recurrent in my work. The criminal’s style of life, formed by age four or five, dictates how time is experienced—as a series of justifications for past wrongs rather than opportunities for growth. As I’ve written, "The style of life typical of an individual is built up very early; we can already find its main features at the age of four or five." Time, therefore, is not linear in the psychological sense; it’s a loop of early misunderstandings that trap the individual unless corrected through cooperative retraining.

Furthermore, space can be understood through the lens of environmental influence on psychological development, though I reject deterministic views of environment. I’ve stated, "There is no compulsion either in environment or in heredity. Children of the same family and the same environment can develop in different ways." Space, as an environmental factor, does not dictate behavior but is interpreted through one’s psychological lens. A child from a poor home may see spatial disparities—between poverty and luxury—as challenges to overcome through crime, yet this is a choice, not a necessity, shaped by their lack of social interest.

Time also intersects with my analysis of physical health and activity, as seen in my references to exercise and its impact on vitality. While not directly about time, the concept of regular activity implies a temporal structure necessary for well-being. I’ve cited, "We have all noticed how much more vivacious, how much more alive and active we are, how much more alert our brains are, and how much clearer and swifter are our thoughts, when we take a great deal of wholesome exercise out of doors." Time spent in inactivity distorts our mental clarity, suggesting that our temporal experience of life—feeling alive versus sluggish—is tied to how we engage with rhythmic, bodily practices.

Additionally, space in my framework relates to the psychological distance created by social prejudice and personal deficiencies. For instance, I’ve discussed how physical appearance or social status creates perceived spatial barriers, noting, "Among criminals, also, we often find ugly persons; and this fact has been used as evidence of the importance of heredity. But think what it feels like to be an ugly child!" Space here is not just physical but social—a dimension of exclusion where one feels distanced from others due to superficial traits, further entrenching a non-cooperative stance.

Time, in a parallel sense, is the dimension where one’s inferiority complex plays out, often driving criminal behavior as a misguided attempt to assert control over the future. I’ve observed, "In all this we can see his inferiority complex. He is running away from the conditions of labor and from the tasks of life in association." Time becomes a race against perceived inadequacies, where the criminal seeks quick, non-cooperative victories rather than enduring, socially beneficial achievements, distorting their temporal horizon into short-term gains.

Space, moreover, is where the physical and psychological meet, as seen in my references to the body’s need for movement within environments. The lack of exercise, akin to the confinement of wild animals, creates a spatial restriction that impacts mental health. I’ve referenced, "Imprisoned wild animals frequently die of fatty degeneration of the heart, due to lack of exercise in their captivity." Space, when constrained, mirrors psychological confinement, suggesting that our perception of spatial freedom is integral to mental and physical vitality.

Lastly, time in my philosophy is tied to the concept of social evolution and personal reform. The criminal’s inability to reform without cooperative training reflects a stunted temporal progression. As I’ve argued, "We cannot win him by making things easy for him, any more than by making them hard for him. We cannot win him by pointing out that he is wrong and arguing with him." Time, for transformation, must be spent in retraining social interest, not in punitive measures that freeze one in a past of resentment and justification.

Expanding on these ideas, I believe space and time are not objective realities but are deeply subjective, filtered through our psychological mechanisms like projection and externalization. Space often becomes the externalized field of our internal conflicts, much like how I describe religious surrender as externalizing the ego-ideal. The vastness or confinement we perceive in space reflects whether we’ve aligned our will with values or succumbed to mere desires. A person trapped in desire, like the alcoholic, experiences space as a series of barriers—bars, bottles, or social exclusions—that keep them from valued connection.

Time, conversely, is the internal rhythm of our will’s struggle to assert itself over base urges. In my work on addiction, I emphasize that time is experienced as a weakening of will when conduct violates values. The alcoholic’s binges are temporal ruptures, moments where time slips into chaos because desire overrides purpose. True temporal coherence comes when one finds a calling, as I argue for OCD, turning time into a constructive progression rather than a destructive loop.

Space also plays a role in my understanding of OCD and philosophical doubt, where retreat into internal thought mirrors a spatial withdrawal from the world. Philosophers and obsessive-compulsives, in my view, create a mental space—a bubble of isolation—where they avoid external engagement. This spatial retreat is a defense mechanism, paralleling the criminal’s physical evasion, showing how space is both a literal and figurative construct in human psychology.

Time, in this context, becomes a measure of estrangement or alignment with purpose. For the obsessive-compulsive, time without purpose is torturous, filled with repetitive rituals that mark a failure to progress. My cure—finding a calling—restructures time, subordinating internal conflicts to a master plan. Time thus shifts from a marker of stagnation to one of dynamic growth, reflecting my broader view that psychological health hinges on temporal alignment with values.

Moreover, space in social terms is the arena of cooperation or conflict, as I extensively discuss in criminal psychology. A society with vast disparities in wealth creates spatial tensions—luxury versus poverty—that challenge social interest. These spatial divides are not just physical but psychological, fostering envy or resentment when cooperation is untrained. My solution involves diminishing ostentation, reducing spatial challenges that provoke non-cooperative responses.

Time’s role in societal reform is equally critical. I advocate for early intervention in childhood to develop social interest, noting that criminal careers often begin in adolescence. Time spent in cooperative education reshapes future temporal experiences, preventing the cycles of crime that mark a life without purpose. This temporal investment in youth promises rapid societal improvement, aligning personal and collective timelines toward mutual benefit.

In conclusion, space and time, in my philosophical and psychological framework, are constructs deeply intertwined with human striving, social interest, and internal conflict. Space is the external projection of our psychological divisions, a field shaped by cooperation or isolation, while time is the internal measure of our will’s alignment with purpose over desire. Both are experienced through the lens of early conditioning and social training, reflecting my core belief that human perception is always mediated by psychological mechanisms. Understanding and reshaping these perceptions through cooperative training is essential to overcoming the distortions that plague individual and societal life.
