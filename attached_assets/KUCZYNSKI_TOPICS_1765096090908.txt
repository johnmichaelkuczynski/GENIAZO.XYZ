## I. CRITIQUE OF EMPIRICISM

### A. General Critique
1. Empiricism cannot explain observable events because it forbids embedding them in unobservable continuities.
2. Empiricism is fundamentally incompatible with a scientific psychology.
3. The term "empirical thought" is an oxymoron.
4. Scientific thought is not the same as empirical thought.
5. To the extent that thought mediates between observations and beliefs, beliefs are not directly supported by observation.
6. Most philosophers make heavy concessions to empiricism without empiricism-independent justification.
7. Empiricism is self-refuting: if true, there are no grounds for believing it; if there are grounds, it is false.
8. If empiricism is correct, we cannot know to what degree our sensory experiences are veridical.
9. If empiricism is correct, the future cannot be known on the basis of the present.
10. The acceptance of empiricism is incompatible with the very existence of any attempt to study anything.
11. Hume accepted skepticism about perception and induction because they were corollaries of empiricism, instead of rejecting empiricism.
12. Empiricism is inimical to the idea of invisible structure.
13. Empiricist philosophers of science deny that anything makes anything happen.
14. Strict empiricism is inconsistent with the fact that modern physics is a source of knowledge.

### B. Empiricism's Errors About Relations and Properties
15. Empiricists treat truth as a one-place relation (property) rather than a multi-place relation.
16. Empiricist subjectivism about arithmetic reflects inability to countenance non-spatiotemporal entities.
17. Empiricism mistakenly treats relations as properties.
18. Empiricism often treats 3-place relations as 2-place relations.
19. Conventionalization is culture-level subjectivization.

### C. Empiricism's Errors About Knowledge
20. We do not sense-perceive forces or causal powers.
21. The concept of confirmation is incoherent unless non-empirical knowledge is granted (Goodman's grue argument).
22. Induction does not have a strictly observational basis; there must be non-observational grounds for preferring certain properties over others in inductive inference.
23. There cannot be strictly observation-based knowledge that an object's length is given by an irrational number.
24. Perception cannot self-justify; justification for perception must come from non-empirical, analytic principles.

## II. PHILOSOPHY OF MIND

### A. Consciousness and the Unconscious
1. The mind would consist only of disconnected spontaneities if completely described by conscious experience alone.
2. Conscious events must be embedded within otherwise unconscious psychological continuities to be explained.
3. There is unconscious ideation.
4. There is ideation that is not only unconscious but subpersonal.
5. Mentality and consciousness are not identical.
6. The nucleus of one's self is consciousness.
7. Consciousness qua consciousness is capable only of iconic (pictorial) representation.
8. Concepts are not constituents of consciousness but are access-conscious.
9. There is a crucial distinction between access-consciousness and consciousness-proper.

### B. Personal vs. Subpersonal Mentation
10. There is such a thing as subpersonal mentation.
11. Subpersonal cognitive operations mediate vision, language-comprehension, and musical ability.
12. Subpersonal mentation is inherently intelligent, whereas personal/conscious mentation is inherently unintelligent.
13. Your mind figures out how to convert sensory disturbances into visual images, but not you (your self).
14. It would be viciously regressive to say the self carried out cognitive operations underlying sense-perception.
15. The Chomskyan unconscious is impersonal; the Freudian unconscious is personal.
16. Sub-personal processes are not strictly physiological; they embody intelligence and are not purely reflexive.
17. Subpersonal knowledge is never transferred from one mental stratum to another; conscious knowledge is merely an analogue.

### C. Propositional Attitudes
18. Propositional attitudes are not constituents of consciousness.
19. Propositional attitudes cannot be constituents of consciousness; they are access-conscious at most.
20. The deployment of a propositional attitude is not constitutive of consciousness.
21. A belief exists and is operative even when one is not conscious of it.
22. Emotions are distinct from their manifestations in consciousness.
23. Emotions are enduring psychological structures, not ephemeral events.
24. Emotions are beliefs, though they are not discursive beliefs; they are fundamentally egocentric in nature.
25. Beliefs, like emotions, are enduring structures to be distinguished from the constituents of consciousness to which they may give rise.

### D. Perception
26. Perception is not mere sensation; perceptions are articulated sensations.
27. Articulations of perception correspond to conceptual knowledge.
28. Perception requires conceptual articulation; it is not mere sensation but articulated sensation.
29. Perception is description—seeing Larry involves seeing that various properties are instantiated.
30. Perceptions represent objects by encoding existence-claims that those objects satisfy.
31. Perceptual data is as theory-laden as psychological data.
32. Visual sensations do not by themselves tell you what color an object is; background knowledge is required.
33. No sensory experience by itself tells one anything; it must be put in context of background knowledge.
34. Introspection is an act of conceptualization, not theoretically innocent reportage.

### E. Self and Agency
35. All selves are minds, but not all minds are selves.
36. A self is a mind that is an agent.
37. An agent is a mind that acts, not just reacts.
38. Where there are no values, there are no selves.
39. Selfhood requires a regulatory agency under whose jurisdiction mental activity falls.
40. Selfhood is a matter of degree.
41. Rational agents are fundamentally different from mere reflex machines or reagents.
42. The self is a rationality-constituted superstructure whose original purpose was to ensure survival but whose developed purpose is self-honing.

### F. Critique of Searle and Functionalism
43. Searle's view that mentality is identical with consciousness is logically false.
44. Dispositionalism about mental states fails to model the data.
45. If beliefs were merely dispositions, knowledge-constitutive beliefs would be nothing more than arbitrary opinions.
46. Functionalism amounts to the denial that the mental (qua mental) has any causal powers.
47. Functionalism denies the very existence of minds.
48. Functionalism gets the order of explanation wrong: you stop because you see a stop-sign, not vice versa.

### G. Critique of Eliminativism
49. The Dennett-Churchland eliminativist position on mind is untenable.
50. Dennett and Churchland's eliminativism about the mental, if cogent, would establish the non-existence of the non-mental as well.
51. The projector itself cannot be a projection; the mind cannot be eliminated from the scientific picture.

---

## III. PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

### A. Propositions and Meanings
1. Propositions are not identical with sentences.
2. Propositions consist of concepts.
3. Propositions are non-spatiotemporal.
4. Propositions consist of properties.
5. Properties are constituents of propositions.
6. Propositions exist independently of human beings; they are not human creations, whereas sentences are.
7. Propositions are properties; truth is instantiatedness.
8. Meanings are identical with sets of properties.
9. Concepts are the meanings of predicates, not psychological entities.
10. A sentence is meaningful if it attributes some property to some object.
11. Any non-compound sentence either says of some individual that it has some property or says that individuals are interrelated in a certain way.

### B. Critique of Wittgenstein
12. Wittgenstein's view that "meaning is use" is false.
13. Meaning cannot be use.
14. There are meaningful expressions that are never used literally and infinitely many that aren't used at all.
15. Once you know what an expression means, you won't acquire new knowledge by acquiring knowledge of how that word is used.
16. Wittgenstein's view that meanings don't exist has been refuted.
17. Wittgenstein's private language argument fails.
18. Wittgenstein's contention that philosophical argumentation is misconceived was a post hoc attempt to legitimate his wanting arguments.
19. Wittgenstein is a hard-core empiricist.
20. Wittgenstein's view that "thinking is not a mental process" is false.
21. Wittgenstein denied thoughts have existence apart from overt manifestations.

### C. Semantics and Reference
22. The distinction between semantics and presemantics is crucial—between literal meanings and information used to identify those meanings.
23. Semantic externalism is true: meaning is not wholly determined by internal psychological states.
24. Content internalism is also true: what we are thinking is wholly determined by our internal states.
25. The distinction between reference-fixing and meaning-giving dissolves tensions between externalism and internalism.
26. Indirect referentialism is committed to an incoherent semantic view.
27. Indirect reference is identical with Russellian quantification.
28. The Theory of Descriptions has a single rule for the semantics of definite descriptions.
29. Direct reference theory does not show that names express no concepts whatsoever.

### D. Linguistic Competence
30. Linguistic competence enhances cognitive competence.
31. Without linguistic competence, a creature could not think discursively at the level of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations.
32. Linguistic competence is constitutively, not merely causally, related to cognitive competence.
33. It is a conceptual necessity that certain cogitations need linguistic vehicles.
34. The English language is a collection of rules.
35. People absorb and apply linguistic rules without the slightest difficulty.
36. If you have conscious, discursive knowledge of word meanings, that knowledge wouldn't operate quickly enough for real-time language comprehension.

---

## IV. LOGIC AND FORMAL TRUTH

### A. Logical Relations
1. Logical relations hold among propositions, not sentences.
2. The spatiotemporal world comprises no instances of logical relations.
3. Entailment holds if, given P, it is not even a theoretical possibility that Q should fail to be true.
4. Confirmation holds if, given P, it is ceteris paribus more likely than not that Q is true.
5. Formal entailment holds among propositions, not expressions.
6. Expression-tokens entail one another only in a derivative sense, via their meanings.
7. Logical relations hold among meanings, not among expressions per se.
8. All entailment is not formal entailment (contra Wittgenstein's Tractatus).
9. Knowing that a formal entailment is valid requires knowing that some informal entailment is valid.

### B. Formal Truth and Incompleteness
10. Arithmetical truth cannot be formalized: any formal characterization of arithmetic is either inconsistent or incomplete.
11. Gödel proved the class of arithmetical truths is not recursively definable.
12. Formal truth is a relation to a recursive proof system, not a monadic property.
13. There is no decision procedure for formality itself.
14. There is no unified essence of 'formal truth' to be discovered.
15. Formality has no form and cannot recursively characterize itself.
16. There is no recursive definition of 'recursive definition'.
17. Incompleteness goes all the way up—it's a structural feature appearing at every level.
18. The space of logical systems is irreducibly plural.
19. The dream of a unified formal framework is dead.

### C. Analytic Truth
20. Not all analytic truths are tautologies.
21. Tautologies (definitional truths) are actually empirical truths about language.
22. All mathematical truths are analytic truths.
23. Truths of arithmetic are analytically true but not formally true.
24. An analytic truth holds entirely in virtue of its own content.
25. Some analytic truths are "hard analytic" (non-obvious conceptual truths).
26. What Kant calls synthetic a priori truths are actually hard analytic truths.

### D. Critique of Logical Positivism
27. Logical positivism holds that meaningful statements are either tautologies or empirical.
28. LP is self-refuting: it is neither a tautology nor empirically verifiable, so by its own criterion it is meaningless.
29. There are non-empirical truths that have nothing to do with anyone's linguistic practices.
30. The very essence of logical positivism is the denial of meaning (propositions).

---

## V. METAPHYSICS

### A. Properties and Universals
1. Properties are non-spatiotemporal entities.
2. Concepts are non-spatiotemporal.
3. The view that properties are identical with scattered objects composed of their instances is false.
4. Two uninstantiated properties would be identical if properties were identical with their instances (reductio).
5. One can change a scattered object without affecting the corresponding property.
6. Properties exist; their existence is validated by obviously true statements.
7. Properties are not identical with spatiotemporal entities.

### B. Facts, Events, and Truths
8. Facts are distributions or redistributions of mass-energy.
9. A truth is distinct from the fact in virtue of which it holds.
10. Events are redistributions of mass-energy.
11. Events are nominalizations of truths, not constituents of the external world.
12. The world doesn't consist of truths; it consists of facts.
13. Truths hold in virtue of facts but aren't identical with facts.
14. The spatiotemporal world doesn't consist of discrete events.
15. The world has an analogue, not a digital structure.

### C. Mind-Body Relations
16. The physical world is causally closed.
17. The mental affects the physical, therefore the mental must be physical (ontological materialism).
18. Explanatory dualism is true even if ontological dualism is false.
19. There is no way to understand why physicalistic statements being true should entail mentalistic statements being true.
20. Psychology and physiology are more remote from each other than physiology and microphysics.
21. Psychological propositions do not present facts as being in physical space.
22. Cognitive processes are realized by physiological processes, but psychological relations between physiological events cannot be understood in physiological terms.
23. Physiological properties are multiply realizable with respect to microphysical properties.
24. Macro-level properties cannot be reduced to microphysical properties.

---

## VI. CAUSATION

### A. Nature of Causation
1. Causation is a relation between events, not objects.
2. Objects are not causes; only events are causes.
3. The concept of persistence is itself a causal notion.
4. Anything that persists is, for that very reason, a causal sequence.
5. We observe causal sequences whenever we observe anything.
6. The notion of spatial occupancy is a causal concept.
7. Anything that says anything about the spatiotemporal world has causal content.
8. The essence of causation is continuity—continuous event-series are causal.
9. There can be no spatiotemporal changes without causal changes because spatiotemporal changes are causal changes.

### B. Critique of Hume
10. Hume's analysis of causation as mere constant conjunction is false.
11. We perceive instances of causation directly when we perceive instances of persistence and occupancy.
12. Hume's analysis cannot distinguish epiphenomenal causation from actual causation.
13. Day doesn't cause night, even though night regularly follows day.
14. We know intuitively what causes what before looking for regularities.
15. A Hume-world without causation is impossible because any instance of persistence or occupancy is an instance of causation.
16. Hume's analysis of causation involves a failure to distinguish facts from truths.

### C. Critique of Counterfactual Analysis
17. The counterfactual analysis of causation (CF) is a failure.
18. Even if CF is extensionally correct, it's no analysis of causality.
19. Counterfactuals are themselves to be understood in terms of causality.
20. CF is guilty of vicious circularity.
21. CF assumes there's no causal redundancy in the world, but sometimes there are back-up mechanisms.
22. Lewis's analysis of counterfactual truth in terms of possible worlds fails.
23. The possible worlds analysis of counterfactuals is completely preposterous.
24. Counterfactuals are grammatical variants of ordinary causal or logical statements.

### D. Space, Time, and Causation
25. The concepts of space and time are to be understood in terms of causality.
26. Order in time is to be understood in causal terms.
27. Order in space is to be understood in causal terms.
28. Space and time are not empty containers; spatiotemporal positions are relations between events.
29. Space-time has an analogue, not digital, structure.

---

## VII. PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE

### A. Scientific Explanation
1. The Deductive-Nomological (DN) model of scientific explanation is false.
2. DN is viciously circular because distinguishing nomic from accidental generalizations requires prior causal knowledge.
3. Knowledge of singular causation precedes knowledge of covering laws, not vice versa.
4. Low-resolution explanations (identifying the cause) are genuine explanations even without knowledge of operative laws.
5. Pre-scientific explanations are not non-explanations—they are correct but incomplete.
6. Explanation is discontinuity-elimination.
7. Explanation is reverse-prediction.
8. Science is not about sticking to facts but about organizing facts by positing hidden structures.

### B. Laws and Regularities
9. Laws are not regularities; they are dispositive of regularities.
10. Laws of nature are not perfect concomitances—a law can exist even if no instances occur.
11. Laws need not be exceptionless regularities to have genuine explanatory value.
12. Accidental generalizations don't receive support from their instances; only principled generalizations do.
13. The Raven Paradox arises from failing to distinguish extensional from intensional readings of generalizations.

### C. Program-Causes and Explanation
14. Causes are INUS conditions: Insufficient but Non-redundant parts of Unnecessary but Sufficient conditions.
15. Explanation almost always involves identifying program-causes—structures that predetermine specific events.
16. Different disciplines deal with different program-causes and distinct nomic connections.
17. Biology isn't just bad physics; psychology isn't just bad physiology.
18. Predictions are almost always made on the basis of knowledge of program-causes.

### D. Probability
19. Probability is an epistemic concept.
20. Probability is a property of statements, not of states of affairs.
21. Probability is inherently relational.
22. A complete description of the universe would contain no probability statements.
23. Probability is "a measure of ignorance."
24. Statistical probability differs from explanatory probability.

---

## VIII. EPISTEMOLOGY

### A. A Priori Knowledge
1. A priori knowledge is constitutive of one's ability to reason and learn from experience.
2. We couldn't learn from experience without a priori knowledge.
3. Observation cannot apprise us of what is incompatible with what.
4. A creature cannot acquire knowledge of bearing relations unless it already has such knowledge.
5. A priori knowledge is not an object of thought but the ability to think itself.
6. Mathematical knowledge results from ratiocinative processes triggered by perception, not transmitted by it.
7. Non-empirical knowledge is purely conceptual, concerning structures and interrelations of concepts.

### B. Critique of Foundationalism
8. Sellars destroyed "the myth of the given" but Berkeley made essentially the same points two hundred years earlier.
9. The foundationalist picture holds that no empirical background knowledge is needed for perception—this is false.
10. There are two senses in which knowledge is not "given": it presupposes background knowledge, and sensory experience alone doesn't constitute knowledge.
11. The epistemic significance of a quale is not fixed; it is a variable function of background empirical knowledge.
12. No sensory experience is foundational; empirical knowledge requires putting current experiences in context.

### C. Self-Knowledge
13. One must distinguish having a propositional attitude from knowing that one has it.
14. Knowing that one feels a certain way involves making a judgment about one's mental state.
15. The judgments we make about what our mental states express are often quite wrong.
16. Nobody is perfectly transparent to himself; nobody is conscious of everything in his mind.
17. Having meta-cognitive wherewithal is required to know what one's propositional attitudes are.

---

## IX. PSYCHOANALYSIS AND DEPTH PSYCHOLOGY

### A. Repression
1. People can rationalize and deceive themselves.
2. People can repress knowledge they wish they didn't have.
3. People can be internally conflicted, and internal conflict is a battle between conscious and unconscious conceits.
4. Repressed emotions may be expressed as symptoms.
5. The concept of repression is coherent despite seemingly cogent arguments against it.
6. There are two distinct kinds of repression (repression₁ and repression₂).
7. Repression₁ involves deliberate, conscious intention not to follow up on suggestive leads.
8. Repression₂ involves already-formed beliefs and its essence is dissociation.
9. Both forms of repression involve rationalization.
10. Without rationalization, it is hard or impossible to repress an idea or keep it repressed.
11. Repressions tend to outlive their usefulness.
12. The result of ongoing repression is loss of both ratiocinative and ethical integrity.

### B. Self-Deception
13. People routinely deceive themselves, and it would be hard to exaggerate how often or how discrepantly with the truth.
14. The view that self-deception is conceptually incoherent is itself a case of self-deception.
15. Self-deception presupposes that, at some level, one has knowledge of the thing of which one lacks conscious knowledge.
16. Rationalizations are moralizations: attempts to make the immoral seem moral.

### C. Defense of Freud
17. Freud's theories are theoretically extraordinarily conservative.
18. Freud was simply making explicit the principles we ordinarily use when making intuitive judgments about other people.
19. People dismiss Freud's theories, despite their staggering explanatory power, because they don't want to be told they lie to themselves.
20. Arguments against Freudian psychology are pitifully weak and involve regressions to crude, demonstrably false positions.
21. Contemporary theoretical psychology's denial of emotions and repression is itself an instance of repression.

---

## X. PSYCHOPATHOLOGY

### A. Psychopathy and Sociopathy
1. A psychopath is someone who doesn't have a conscience and never had one.
2. A sociopath is someone who had a conscience but ceased to have one.
3. Sociopathogenesis involves implementing a certain sort of rationalization.
4. Sociopaths are people who "sell out" and "die inside."
5. The pre-sociopath has values, internal conflict, capacity to love, and grasps non-instrumental goodness.
6. The sociopath lacks values, internal conflict, capacity to love, and grasp of non-instrumental goodness.
7. Psychopathy is a kind of perpetual infantilism.
8. Sociopathy is psychological suicide: the destruction of one's value-based psychological architecture.
9. Sociopaths do not have friends because they do not have values.

### B. Borderline Personality Disorder
10. People with BPD have two distinct, simultaneously operative psychological "operating systems."
11. One BPD operating system is appropriately adult and sane; the other is infantile in nature.
12. One part of the BPD person's mind remained fixated at an early phase of life, usually due to trauma.
13. People with BPD oscillate between their two psychological integrations.
14. The BPD person's preferred psychological defense is splitting, not repression.
15. It is wrong to infer that BPD people are psychopaths.

### C. OCD
16. Obsessive beliefs are pseudo-beliefs.
17. Compulsive acts are pseudo-acts.
18. The essence of OCD is ambivalence.
19. Obsessional belief represents the opposite of what one actually believes.
20. Compulsive action is driven by an intention to do the opposite of what one's doing.
21. Obsessive fears often represent disguised desires.

### D. Other Conditions
22. Neurotic people perceive external reality accurately but are blind to their own feelings.
23. Psychosis involves partial cognitive regression where infantile and adult thought pathologically commingle.
24. Mental illness is NOT "an illness like any other"—it differs categorically from physical illness.
25. Mental illnesses are contextual in nature and often serve a defensive/protective function.
26. Pathological insecurity and pathological grandiosity are two sides of the same coin.

---

## XI. ETHICS AND VALUE THEORY

### A. Values and Agency
1. Values are not desires.
2. Liking something differs from valuing it.
3. A value is a judgment that a course of action increases the scope of one's agency.
4. What is valuable is what consolidates one's agency.
5. Happiness presupposes a value-system.
6. Happiness consists in judging oneself to have measured up to certain benchmarks.
7. One's personhood depends on having values.

### B. Free Will and Autonomy
8. Free acts require that second-order desires align with first-order desires.
9. Freedom consists primarily in being oneself, secondarily in being able to do what one wants.
10. Truly free acts are driven by values, not merely by higher-order desires.
11. Rational conduct differs from intelligent conduct.
12. An irrational act can involve enormous intelligence.
13. A rational act embodies due regard for one's various interests.
14. Persons, unlike non-persons, subject their own desires to critical scrutiny.
15. Rationality is intellectual autonomy.
16. Autonomy is practical rationality.
17. Agency in the robust sense is identical with rationality, autonomy, and moral responsibility.

### C. Moral Realism
18. Moral nihilism and aesthetic nihilism are both false.
19. Moral nihilism and moral relativism are equivalent doctrines.
20. The Moore-Hume thesis that you cannot derive an "ought" from an "is" is false.
21. Moral truths hold in virtue of the same facts as descriptive truths.
22. Morally good acts invariably conduce to psychological, biological, or psychobiological welfare.
23. Hume's emotivism—the view that moral ideation is non-judicative sentiment—is wrong.
24. There is no moral difference without a descriptive difference; the moral supervenes on the descriptive.
25. Moral intuitions track biological facts about welfare and harm.
26. Emotions can be justified or unjustified, rational or irrational—properties that only beliefs can have.

### D. Critique of Kant
27. Kant's two categorical imperatives (universalizability and respect for autonomy) are not equivalent.
28. CI1 (universalizability test) is false.
29. CI2 (respect autonomy) is approximately correct.
30. Kant wrongly assumed nothing other than a good will has inherent moral worth.
31. Autonomy itself must be inherently good if intention to respect autonomy is inherently good.
32. Kant's argument linking morality and self-interest involves a massive non-sequitur.

---

## XII. PHILOSOPHY OF LAW

### A. Nature of Legal Obligation
1. Legal obligation is a species of moral obligation.
2. Legal obligations persist even when outweighed.
3. Legal obligation holds wherever state protection holds.
4. Legal obligation fails wherever recognition fails.
5. Legal normativity is moral normativity under legal description.
6. Legal obligation exists only within morally structured systems.
7. A law is an assurance of moral protection.
8. A legal system is a system of such assurances.

### B. Law and Morality
9. Laws have a basis in morality because assurances are moral acts.
10. Wicked laws can still have normative force due to background protections.
11. Legal obligation emerges from systemic features, not individual mandates.
12. Even overridden obligations remain obligations.
13. Principles have weight rather than binary force.
14. Legal obligations behave like moral principles in weight.
15. The question of whether law requires morality (positivism vs. anti-positivism) is to be resolved through logical, not empirical, analysis.

---

## XIII. CRITIQUE OF KANT'S EPISTEMOLOGY

1. Kant's arguments about causation and induction are spurious.
2. Kant erroneously assumes all non-empirical truths are trivial.
3. Kant confuses the psychological and logical meanings of "concept."
4. Kant's views on synthetic a priori truths reflect his conflation of psychology with logic.
5. Kant's reasoning must be "de-psychologized" to be valid.
6. Kant's definitions of "analytic" and "a priori" are flawed.
7. Analyticity should be understood as conceptual necessity.
8. 7+5=12 is analytic, not synthetic.
9. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points is analytic.
10. Kant presupposes anti-realism or psychologism about concepts.
11. Intuition for Kant is a para-perceptual act of imaging.
12. Kant's mistake is an overly narrow conception of analyticity.
13. Transcendental arguments are cogent if rephrased in terms of hard analyticity.
14. Kant erroneously made mathematics a branch of psychology.

---

## XIV. A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE AND CHOMSKY

### A. Chomsky's Contributions
1. Chomsky's two contributions to philosophy are: (1) the poverty of stimulus argument for pre-experiential knowledge, and (2) his argument for the existence of sub-personal thought.
2. Humans learn language due to their innate cognitive structure.
3. Without pre-existing cognitive structure, no amount of sensory stimulation would lead to language acquisition.
4. It is your mind's innate structure that enables acquisition of linguistic ability and other forms of cognitive competence.
5. The knowledge Chomsky discusses is not knowledge that your mind has; that knowledge IS your mind.
6. The a priori knowledge Chomsky discusses is not internal to your cognitive framework: it IS your cognitive framework.
7. Languages are both productive and systematic.
8. Language is productive and systematic because our minds are productive and systematic.
9. The fact that we can learn language is proof that pre-experiential structural properties are cognitive, not merely physiological.

### B. Structure of A Priori Knowledge
10. You are not aware of your cognitive framework because it itself is your awareness.
11. The framework-constitutive structures and operations that mediate learning are deeply unconscious.
12. The contents of the Freudian unconscious are unconscious, but not deeply so.
13. Our cognitive structure can be deduced from our thought-patterns.
14. Thoughts, perceptions, and feelings are not themselves the cognitive structure but are its productions.

---

## XV. RUSSELL'S PARADOX AND SEMANTIC PARADOXES

1. Russell, Tarski, and other logicians were wrong that there are meaningless bona fide sentences.
2. Alleged antinomies are either false or are sentence-schemata, not actual sentences.
3. Russell's Paradox does not demonstrate a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension.
4. The expression "the property of not being a member of itself" does not have a referent.
5. K₁ ("K is a member of itself") fails to encode a proposition because "itself" doesn't refer to anything.
6. Type Theory (TT) is self-defeating because it is given by a sentence that violates its own stricture.
7. There are two classes of antinomies: meaningless ones and false ones.
8. "This sentence is false" tokens are neither true nor false, not both true and false.
9. The semantic rules of English do not permit the construction of sentences that violate the Law of Non-Contradiction.
10. Natural languages are not defective in the way logicians have alleged.
11. No language can state all of its own semantic rules—there is a proof of this.

---

## XVI. AESTHETICS AND MUSIC

1. Pleasant affects alert us to certain structural features in works of art.

## XVII. LIBET EXPERIMENTS AND FREE WILL

1. The experiments establish that consciousness of intention follows rather than precedes the intention itself.
2. Consciousness may serve to approve or disapprove of decisions already made rather than to make decisions.
3. The concept of "free will" is so unclear that difficulties applying experimental findings reflect problems with the concept.

5. The more deliberation and "rational reflection" involved in an action, the less likely the operative intention is to be fully conscious.
6. Libet's experiment represents an extremely valuable but missed opportunity for philosophy.
7. W (conscious awareness) does not have a decisive role in causing the action.

## XVIII. PHILOSOPHICAL METHODOLOGY

1. Analytic philosophy (broadly construed) is philosophy done in the careful, clear-headed, systematic way that Frege approached problems.
2. Analytic philosophers solve problems by clarifying statements, not by ontologizing.
3. Philosophical insight is acquired by analyzing meanings and clarifying statements, not by positing entities.
4. Philosophical puzzles are purely conceptual and result from confusion, not ignorance.
5. Scientific puzzles involve acquiring new data; philosophical puzzles are solved by conceptual analysis.
6. No philosophical assertions are empirical; observation cannot tell you whether one statement is inconsistent with another.
7. Philosophy justifies assumptions that empirical sciences cannot justify themselves.
8. Philosophers tend not to admit when they're wrong, thwarting philosophical progress.
9. There may be a fundamental difference between explanations in physical sciences and psychological sciences.
