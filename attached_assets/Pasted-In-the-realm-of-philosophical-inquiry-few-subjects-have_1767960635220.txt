In the realm of philosophical inquiry, few subjects have been as persistently debated as the nature of causation. David Hume, an 18th-century philosopher, made significant contributions to this discourse, proposing a theory of causation that has been both influential and controversial. Hume's theory posits that causation is nothing more than a habitual association of events, where one event consistently follows another, leading us to infer a causal link. He famously argued that our understanding of causation is derived from the observation of constant conjunctions and temporal precedence, rather than any inherent connection between cause and effect.

However, I contend that Hume's theory of causation is fundamentally flawed. The crux of my argument lies in Hume's assumption that precedence in time and adjacency in space can be understood in non-causal terms, which is incorrect. This assumption underpins his entire theory, leading to a conception of causation that is both reductive and inadequate.

To begin with, Hume's view that causation is merely the habitual association of events fails to capture the true nature of causal relationships. He argues that when we observe one event consistently following another, we come to expect the second event whenever the first occurs. This expectation, according to Hume, is the basis of our idea of causation. However, this perspective overlooks the necessity that we intuitively ascribe to causal connections. The mere observation of temporal succession does not account for the inherent necessity we perceive in causal relationships.

In examining the flaws of Hume's theory of causation, it is crucial to delve deeper into the assumptions he makes about time and space. Hume posits that causation is merely a matter of temporal succession and spatial contiguity, devoid of any intrinsic causal connection. This view, however, is predicated on the notion that time and space can be understood independently of causation, which I argue is a fundamental error.

Hume's assumption that temporal precedence and spatial adjacency can be comprehended in non-causal terms is not only false but also undermines the coherence of his entire theory. Time and space, as we experience them, are inherently tied to causal processes. The very concepts of "before" and "after," or "near" and "far," are intelligible only within a framework that presupposes causation. Without an understanding of causal relationships, these temporal and spatial concepts lose their meaning.

Moreover, the concept of material causes, as Hume presents it, is incoherent. The idea that objects themselves stand in dependence-relations is a misconception. Instead, it is propositions that stand in these relations. This distinction is crucial because it shifts the focus from the physical objects to the logical structures that underpin our understanding of causation. By recognizing that propositions, rather than objects, are the true bearers of causal relations, we can better appreciate the complexity and depth of causal interactions.

In conclusion, Hume's theory of causation is fundamentally flawed due to its reliance on the assumption that precedence in time and adjacency in space can be understood in non-causal terms. This assumption is not only false but also undermines the coherence of his entire theory. By reducing causation to mere temporal succession and spatial contiguity, Hume neglects the intrinsic causal connections that are necessary to truly understand the nature of causation. My critique of Hume's theory underscores the need to reject the belief that everything can be explained by physics alone and to recognize the importance of propositions in standing in dependence-relations. This approach allows for a more nuanced and accurate understanding of causation, one that acknowledges the complexity of the relationships that underpin our experience of the world.
