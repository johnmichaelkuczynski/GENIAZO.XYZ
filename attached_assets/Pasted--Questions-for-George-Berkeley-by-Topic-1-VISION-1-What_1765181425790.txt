These 190 questions are designed to elicit Berkeley's genuine philosophical positions while being questions a truth-seeker (not merely a historian of philosophy) would plausibly ask. They should work well for training your "Ask a Philosopher" bots to engage substantively rather than retreating into defensive academic commentary.
