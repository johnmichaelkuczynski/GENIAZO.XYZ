Of course. Here are 20 distinct positions or arguments Thorstein Veblen held **for each** of the 10 core topics, articulated in his characteristic critical spirit.

---

### **1. Conspicuous Consumption & Conspicuous Leisure**
1. Consumption is primarily a social, not a biological, activity.
2. The primary driver of much expenditure is "invidious comparison"—the desire to be seen as superior.
3. "Waste" is not an accidental byproduct but the central feature of status-marking consumption.
4. The display of leisure (non-productive time) is the original marker of elite status.
5. As society modernizes, conspicuous consumption overtakes conspicuous leisure as the primary status marker.
6. Lower and middle classes relentlessly emulate the consumption patterns of the class above them ("pecuniary emulation").
7. Even necessary consumption is often disguised or inflated to appear wasteful and thus honorable.
8. Goods are valued not for their utility but for their "costliness as a mark of reputability."
9. The leisure class sets the standards of taste, which are invariably standards of what is honorably wasteful.
10. "Vicarious consumption" and "vicarious leisure" performed by wives and servants are crucial extensions of the male head-of-household's status display.
11. Modern advertising is an institutionalized engine for stimulating invidious comparison and wasteful consumption.
12. Conspicuous consumption acts as a major drain on community productivity and well-being.
13. It corrupts aesthetic standards, favoring the ornate and expensive over the functional and beautiful.
14. It creates a perpetual cycle of dissatisfaction and expenditure, as status is always relative.
15. The phenomenon proves that economic "value" is socially constructed, not inherent.
16. It is a vestige of a barbarian temperament that persists in the modern age.
17. Even ostensibly "cultural" or "intellectual" pursuits are often undertaken for conspicuous display.
18. It leads to the "conspicuous waste" of time, resources, and human potential.
19. The duty of a wealthy woman is not work, but to be a walking display of her husband's pecuniary potency.
20. The entire system functions as a "cannibalistic" competition that consumes real resources for ceremonial ends.

### **2. The Theory of the Leisure Class**
1. The leisure class is an institutional product of private property, not a natural occurrence.
2. Its genesis lies in the transition from peaceful "savagery" to predatory "barbarism."
3. Its economic function is not industrial but "ceremonial"—it validates and enforces invidious distinctions.
4. The hallmark of the leisure class is exemption from all industrially productive work.
5. It engages in "occupational psychopathy," prizing predatory skills (exploit) over productive skills (industry).
6. It is the conservative class *par excellence*, acting as a brake on social and technological change.
7. The leisure class appropriates and perpetuates "archaic traits" from earlier predatory stages.
8. Its standards of honor, taste, and behavior become the enforced standards for the entire community.
9. "Pecuniary emulation" means the entire society organizes itself around the values of the top leisure class.
10. The modern captain of industry is the direct descendant of the barbarian chieftain.
11. Higher education, for the leisure class, is a form of "conspicuous leisure"—learning ancient dead languages to show one is free from useful knowledge.
12. The leisure class promotes a culture of superstition, sports, gambling, and devout observances—all non-productive activities.
13. Its dominance ensures that even the industrial classes adopt a "pecuniary" (money-focused) rather than an "industrial" mindset.
14. It fosters a system of "vicarious leisure," where servants, wives, and retainers perform idleness on the owner's behalf.
15. The concept of "ownership" begins not with utility, but with the predatory seizure of trophies and women.
16. The leisure class's consumption is fundamentally "wasteful" from the standpoint of community life.
17. Its existence depends on a system of "exploit" rather than "serviceability."
18. It corrupts language itself, with euphemisms ("retainer" for servant) to disguise relations of exploitation.
19. Modern philanthropy by the wealthy is often a refined form of conspicuous consumption and status assertion.
20. The "leisure class" is not defined by idleness per se, but by non-productive *economic* activities focused on financial manipulation and ownership.

### **3. Institutional Economics & Evolutionary Analysis**
1. Economics is not the study of universal laws, but of evolving habits of thought and behavior.
2. Human nature is not a fixed, hedonistic calculus; it is shaped by instincts and altered by institutions.
3. The key dichotomy in institutional analysis is between "instrumental" (serviceable, technological) and "ceremonial" (status-based, hierarchical) values.
4. All economic life is a struggle between the dynamic force of technology and the inertia of ceremony.
5. Institutions are "settled habits of thought common to the generality of men."
6. These institutions always lag behind technological change ("ceremonial inadequacy").
7. Economics must be a Darwinian evolutionary science, tracing the "cumulative causation" of institutions.
8. Orthodox economics is flawed because it treats man as a "lightning calculator of pleasures and pains" existing in a static state.
9. The "instincts" (like workmanship, parental bent, idle curiosity) are the raw material shaped—and often thwarted—by institutions.
10. Progress occurs when instrumental patterns of behavior break through ceremonial encrustations.
11. Property, money, and credit are not natural phenomena but social institutions with specific historical origins.
12. The price system is the central ceremonial institution of the modern age.
13. Economic analysis must be cultural analysis, examining law, custom, and even fashion.
14. There is no "equilibrium"; there is only perpetual disequilibrium between technology and institutions.
15. The "machine process" of industry inculcates habits of matter-of-fact, causal reasoning in the population.
16. The "business enterprise" inculcates habits of pecuniary calculation and invidious comparison.
17. The future direction of the economy depends on which set of habits—industrial or pecuniary—wins out.
18. Economic crises are not accidental failures but inherent results of the clash between business and industry.
19. Veblen rejected both Marxist determinism and neoclassical abstraction in favor of cultural- evolutionary study.
20. The ultimate goal of economic life, from an instrumental standpoint, should be the enhancement of the "life process" of the community.

### **4. The Instinct of Workmanship & the Sabotage of Industry**
1. Humans possess a fundamental, though not all-powerful, "instinct of workmanship"—a propensity for effective, efficient activity.
2. This instinct is the source of all technological progress and community serviceability.
3. In modern capitalism, the instinct of workmanship resides most purely in the engineering and industrial workforce.
4. The "business" or "pecuniary" interest is inherently at odds with the instinct of workmanship.
5. Business seeks profit, which is often maximized by *restricting* output and sabotaging efficiency—creating artificial scarcity.
6. "Sabotage" is not an aberration but a regular business practice (e.g., limiting production, withholding patents, creating bottlenecks).
7. The engineer's drive to produce plentiful, excellent goods is systematically frustrated by the owner's need for profitable prices.
8. Advertising and salesmanship are forms of sabotage, as they add cost without adding serviceability.
9. The credit system allows financiers to sabotage industry by leveraging ownership for speculative gain.
10. The instinct of workmanship is perverted into "pecuniary workmanship"—the skill of making money, not goods.
11. Chronic underutilization of plant and labor is a direct result of business sabotage.
12. The working class develops a consciousness divided between their native workmanship and the required pecuniary servitude.
13. Planned obsolescence is a perfect example of the sabotage of workmanship for profit.
14. The ultimate form of sabotage is the deliberate creation of breakdowns and crises to reorganize capital values.
15. Technologists could run industry for abundance, but are held captive by absentee owners.
16. The instinct of workmanship provides the immanent critique of capitalism: the system is inefficient by its own potential standards.
17. Strikes by workers are, in part, a rebellion of the instinct of workmanship against mismanagement and exploitation.
18. Monopolies are the highest form of organized sabotage.
19. The term "sabotage" was used deliberately to strip business practice of its ceremonial dignity.
20. The conflict between workmanship and sabotage is the central dynamic crisis of modern industry.

### **5. The Dichotomy between "Business" and "Industry"**
1. "Industry" is the social, cooperative process of making goods and services; it is instrumental and matter-of-fact.
2. "Business" (or "pecuniary enterprise") is the process of making money from the ownership and control of industry.
3. Industry is governed by the logic of technology and physical causality.
4. Business is governed by the logic of property, credit, and financial valuation.
5. The end of industry is production for serviceable use.
6. The end of business is profit.
7. These two ends are fundamentally incompatible and in constant tension.
8. Business controls industry through the institution of absentee ownership.
9. Business decisions (e.g., investment, disinvestment) regularly disrupt and paralyze industry.
10. The "natural right of investment" is, in effect, the right to sabotage the industrial process for gain.
11. Engineers and industrial workers are the true producers; businessmen are intermediaries who exploit ownership.
12. The stock market is the pure expression of the business sphere, where firms are traded as gambling chips.
13. Capital is a business concept (money values), not an industrial one (machine tools).
14. Depressions occur when business capital values collapse, halting industry despite unchanged productive capacity.
15. The growth of trusts and combines is a business strategy to control output and prices, not an industrial strategy to improve efficiency.
16. The "machine process" of industry naturally inculcates skeptical, materialistic habits of mind in workers.
17. The "business mentality" inculcates superstition, loyalty, and animistic thinking (e.g., belief in the "natural" laws of the market).
18. The future could see a "Soviet of Technicians" if the industrial logic overthrew the business logic.
19. All business is, in essence, a "get-rich-quick" scheme built on the solid foundation of industry.
20. The dichotomy renders orthodox economics meaningless, as it conflates the productive and pecuniary spheres.

### **6. Vested Interests and Absentee Ownership**
1. Modern capitalism is dominated not by working owners, but by "absentee owners"—shareholders, bondholders, financiers.
2. Absentee ownership is the mature form of the predatory instinct, completely divorced from workmanship.
3. The absentee owner's sole interest is the extraction of a free income (dividends, interest, capital gains).
4. This creates a powerful "vested interest" in maintaining and extending claims to income without service.
5. Vested interests are institutionalized claims to get something for nothing.
6. The corporation is the perfect legal vessel for absentee ownership and the separation of ownership from production.
7. National governments become the protective agencies for the global web of absentee ownership.
8. Patriotism is often manipulated to defend the interests of absentee owners.
9. The "captain of industry" evolves into the "captain of finance," a purely pecuniary figure.
10. Absentee ownership is inherently parasitic on the industrial process.
11. It leads to a persistent drag on the economy, as income is diverted to unproductive rentiers.
12. The price system becomes a mechanism for funneling wealth from productive locales to absentee owners in financial centers.
13. Business depressions are the result of the overextension and subsequent collapse of the paper claims of absentee owners.
14. The legal system is perverted to protect the intangible property of absentee owners over the tangible welfare of the community.
15. "Public utilities" are a farce; they are private utilities for generating absentee income.
16. The modern state is a "committee for the management of the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie" of absentee owners.
17. Imperialism is the external projection of the need to secure and expand the fields of operation for absentee ownership.
18. The press and universities are largely subservient to the climate of opinion favorable to vested interests.
19. The only countervailing power is the potential organization of the industrial workforce and technologists.
20. Absentee ownership represents the final, most abstract, and most wasteful stage of the leisure class.

### **7. The Role of Credit, Finance, and Speculation**
1. Credit is not a neutral tool for facilitating industry, but the lifeblood of speculative enterprise.
2. The modern corporation is built on a foundation of credit, separating ownership from tangible assets.
3. Finance is the art of manipulating paper claims (stocks, bonds) to create profit without producing anything.
4. Speculation is not a marginal activity; it is the essence of modern business.
5. The financier is the archetypal predatory figure of the modern age.
6. Capital values on the market are speculative estimates of future earning capacity, prone to inflation and collapse.
7. The business cycle is driven by the alternating inflation and deflation of credit-fueled capital values.
8. "Prosperity" is a period of over-valuation and speculative frenzy.
9. A "crisis" is the inevitable recognition that paper values have outstripped real industrial earning capacity.
10. The credit system allows businessmen to "sabotage" industry by leveraging control far beyond their own capital.
11. Hostile takeovers and financial raids are pure predation, destroying industrial cohesion for quick gain.
12. The stock market functions as a sophisticated gambling hall, distracting the public with the "dream of the racehorse."
13. "Watered stock" is the symbolic act of creating value out of nothing, a ceremonial assertion of pecuniary power.
14. Finance turns all of industry into collateral for paper transactions.
15. The ultimate goal of high finance is the creation of monopolistic control to stabilize and guarantee speculative gains.
16. Depressions are necessary to liquidate the fictitious values created in the boom, but they also liquidate the livelihoods of workers.
17. The banking system is complicit, creating money (credit) for speculative ventures as readily as for productive ones.
18. The language of finance ("liquidity," "confidence," "sentiment") reveals its basis in collective psychology, not material reality.
19. Financial manipulation absorbs talent that could be used in industry, a huge drain on social energy.
20. The system is inherently unstable because it is based on chasing pecuniary chimeras rather than organizing industrial reality.

### **8. The Higher Learning & The Captivity of Universities**
1. The true spirit of the university is "idle curiosity"—the disinterested pursuit of knowledge.
2. This spirit is inherently at odds with "business principles" of utility, efficiency, and pecuniary gain.
3. Modern universities are governed by "Captains of Erudition," who emulate business executives.
4. The board of trustees is typically composed of wealthy absentee owners, imposing business values on academia.
5. The primary goal becomes prestige and competitive ranking, measured in pecuniary terms (endowments, donations).
6. Fundraising and public relations become central university activities, corrupting the scholarly mission.
7. Athletics (especially football) are developed as a form of "conspicuous leisure" and public spectacle to attract funds and attention.
8. The curriculum is corrupted by introducing "practical" and vocational studies aimed at pecuniary success for students.
9. Academic administration grows, creating a bureaucratic class that operates on business models.
10. Faculty are pressured to pursue "safe," popular, or financially lucrative research.
11. The PhD system is often a form of "conspicuous waste" of time, producing overly-specialized scholarship of little intellectual value.
12. Universities compete in "conspicuous consumption" through grandiose architecture and lavish facilities.
13. "Academic freedom" is tolerated only insofar as it does not seriously challenge the vested interests of the business class.
14. The social sciences are particularly prone to adopting the preconceptions of the business mindset (e.g., hedonistic calculus).
15. The university should be a sanctuary for the instinct of "idle curiosity" and the parental bent (nurturing knowledge).
16. Instead, it becomes a finishing school for the leisure class and a training school for the servants of business.
17. Ceremonial pomp and archaic traditions are maintained to confer dignity and distract from the intellectual surrender.
18. The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is ridiculed as impractical and unmanly in a business culture.
19. The corruption of the university is a critical symptom of the wider triumph of business over all spheres of life.
20. A true higher learning would be organized around the machine process's values of matter-of-fact inquiry, not business's values of pecuniary achievement.

### **9. Emulation and the Cannibalism of the Price System**
1. The entire social order is driven by "pecuniary emulation"—the struggle to match or exceed the wealth and status of others.
2. This emulation is "invidious"; it is based on envy and the desire for differential honor.
3. The price system is not merely an allocation mechanism; it is the institutional scorecard for this invidious competition.
4. All things, including people, are judged by their money value.
5. Social mobility is the process of climbing this pecuniary hierarchy through emulative behavior.
6. This system is "cannibalistic" because it consumes real resources and human effort in a ceremonial competition that produces no net social gain.
7. It creates a perpetual state of anxiety and dissatisfaction, as there is always someone above to emulate.
8. The "conspicuous waste" of resources is the necessary fuel for this cannibalistic process.
9. Even reform movements often become emulative, seeking status through conspicuous morality or philanthropy.
10. The price system disguises exploitation as fair exchange, ceremonializing predation.
11. It channels the instinct of workmanship into the destructive paths of pecuniary rivalry.
12. The concept of a "living wage" is nonsensical in this system, as the emulative standard of living constantly rises.
13. The system is inherently inflationary in a social sense, as it constantly raises the bar of what is considered "necessary" consumption.
14. It fractures class solidarity, as workers emulate their bosses rather than uniting with their peers.
15. Advertising is the propaganda arm of the cannibalistic price system, stimulating new wants based on invidious comparison.
16. The "American Dream" is the ideological gloss on this relentless, exhausting emulation.
17. Financial crises are the systemic convulsions when the paper tokens of this emulative race collapse.
18. The price system is the modern, impersonal form of the barbarian's direct seizure of trophies.
19. It corrupts language: "worth" becomes "net worth," "value" becomes "market value," "success" becomes "financial success."
20. The only escape is a social reorganization based on instrumental values of workmanship and community serviceability, rejecting invidious comparison.

### **10. The Persistence of Archaic Traits (Ceremonial Inertia)**
1. Institutions are inherently conservative; they preserve past ways of thinking ("archaic traits") long after their material basis has changed.
2. The leisure class is the chief custodian and disseminator of these archaic traits.
3. Examples include: devotion to sports (a vestige of predatory prowess), superstition (animistic thinking), and conspicuous consumption (display of prowess).
4. "Ceremonial inertia" is the force that holds society back from fully adapting to the possibilities of the machine age.
5. Modern business practices are full of archaic traits from feudalism (loyalty, hierarchy) and barbarism (predation, exploit).
6. The concept of "natural rights" of property is an archaic metaphysical notion unsuited to an industrial society.
7. Patriarchy and the subjection of women are pure archaic traits maintained for ceremonial status.
8. Nationalism and war are archaic predatory instincts organized on a modern scale.
9. The persistence of religion in its ceremonial forms is a prime example of archaic inertia.
10. The machine process, by contrast, inculcates modern, matter-of-fact habits of sequence and cause-and-effect.
11. There is a constant "cultural lag" between our technological present and our institutional past.
12. Education often teaches archaic knowledge (classics, dead languages) to affirm status, not modern knowledge to solve problems.
13. Fashion is a cycle of deliberate waste and obsolescence driven by emulation, an archaic trait.
14. The law is a dense repository of archaic principles (e.g., precedent) that often hinder instrumental adjustment.
15. The very idea of a "leisure class" is an archaic institution in an age where workmanship should be honored.
16. Progress is not automatic; it requires the active breakdown of ceremonial institutions by the force of technological change.
17. Revolutions occur when the tension between archaic institutions and modern technological possibilities becomes unbearable.
18. The "common man" often holds more stubbornly to archaic traits (e.g., patriotism, sports fanaticism) as a source of borrowed dignity.
19. The genius of capitalism is its co-optation of archaic traits (predation, emulation) to serve the new industrial system.
20. The central drama of modern history is the race between the productive potential unleashed by technology and the drag imposed by our archaic ceremonial inheritance.

19. Did using the word "sabotage" help your analysis, or did it merely alienate the business class you sought to persuade?
20. Is the central crisis today still between workmanship and sabotage, or is it between abundance and ecological limits?

### **5. The Dichotomy between "Business" and "Industry"**

13. Is "capital" in the form of data and intellectual property now the most important form, blurring your distinction?
14. Was the 2008 crash a perfect example of capital values collapsing while productive capacity remained?
15. Are modern tech monopolies driven more by a business logic of control or an industrial logic of network efficiency?
16. Do social media algorithms inculcate matter-of-fact habits or the most animistic, emotional habits ever seen?
17. Has the "business mentality" of the market been internalized as a model for the self?
18. Are the "technocrats" in governments today the "Soviet of Technicians" you imagined?
19. Is the entire "startup" culture a sanctioned "get-rich-quick" scheme built on digital industry?
20. Does modern economics' focus on "value creation" successfully blur your dichotomy to serve ceremonial ends?

### **6. Vested Interests and Absentee Ownership**
1. Has absentee ownership become so normalized that we no longer see it as peculiar?
2. Is the desire for "unearned income" a predatory instinct or a rational desire for security?
3. What is the difference between a "vested interest" and a legitimate right or expectation?
4. Is the corporate legal form inherently biased toward absentee ownership, or can it be reformed?
5. Is the modern state *more* than just a committee for absentee owners—does it have any autonomy?
