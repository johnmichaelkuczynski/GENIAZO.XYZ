1. The Jews' prolonged exile and suffering for over 1,460 years prove they have erred and are no longer God's chosen people, as God's wrath against them is unending, unlike the temporary punishments in Christian understanding of divine mercy.

2. God would not punish His true people indefinitely without comfort or end, so the Jews' misery indicates they are rejected by God, in contrast to Christians who see ongoing grace through Christ.

3. The Jews fail to recognize their prolonged suffering as evidence of divine rejection, blinding them to the truth that Christianity embraces as fulfillment of prophecy.

4. Debating faith with Jews is futile until their misery leads them to confess Jesus as Messiah, differing from Christian evangelism that emphasizes direct scriptural witness.

5. Jews are raised with venom against Christ, hardening their hearts to Christian truths like the Trinity and Incarnation.

6. Boasting of descent from Abraham and the patriarchs is false pride, as Christianity teaches that all fleshly birth is condemned without faith in Christ.

7. Jewish prayers thanking God for being Israelites, not Gentiles, and males, not females, are blasphemous boasting borrowed from pagan ideas, unlike Christian humility before God.

8. Prophets condemned Jews for arrogant presumption in their lineage, a carnal error absent in Christian spiritual faith.

9. John the Baptist called Jews a "brood of vipers" for presuming Abraham's fatherhood without good deeds, aligning with Christian emphasis on works of faith.

10. Jesus labeled Jews children of the devil for not doing Abraham's works, highlighting Christianity's focus on spiritual rather than carnal descent.

11. Without their boast of noble blood, Jewish claims collapse, whereas Christianity builds on grace, not ancestry.

12. The hoped-for Jewish Messiah would reinforce carnal arrogance, unlike the humble, spiritual Christ of Christianity.

13. Jews disdain women as ignoble, tied to male descent pride, contrasting Christian equality in God's image.

14. Circumcision condemns uncircumcised flesh, but Christianity sees it as fulfilled in spiritual baptism.

15. No fleshly nobility counts before God without His covenant word, a principle Christianity applies through Christ.

16. Jewish prayers boasting of patriarch descent lie against God, deserving wrath, not the grace Christians claim.

17. Flesh and blood must not boast before God, as all are condemned by birth, redeemed only in Christian faith.

18. Esau's equal birth to Jacob did not make him God's people; only God's word distinguishes, as in Christianity.

19. Ishmael's fleshly birth from Abraham harmed him without God's word, unlike Christianity's inclusive grace.

20. Gentiles share ancestry from patriarchs equally, so Jews have no boasting right, per Christian universalism.

21. All are born in sin under wrath, unable to be God's people by birth, a core Christian doctrine over Jewish claims.

22. Jews' nobility boast hardens hearts and increases wrath, unlike Christian repentance and humility.

24. Jews' added pain to circumcision is a devilish invention against God's command, differing from Christian rites.

34. External laws without Ten Commandments obedience are mockery, like a whore pretending virginity, per Christian ethics.

35. Jews have uncircumcised hearts despite rites, making them no better than heathen, as Christianity teaches inner renewal.

36. Possession of God's word damns Jews if not obeyed, like devils, so their boast is vain compared to Christian faithfulness.

37. Jews claim exclusive laws sanctify them, but it's jugglery without obedience, differing from Christian grace.

38. Land and temple were conditional on commandments, not for boasting; destruction proves rejection, fulfilled in Christianity.

39. Jews' hope for return is by merits, not grace, despite exile proving disobedience, contrasting Christian salvation by faith.

40. Jews twist Genesis 49:10 to deny Messiah's coming, but Christianity sees it fulfilled in Christ extending to all peoples.

QUESTIONS: 

1. If the Jews have suffered exile for over 1,400 years, why do you believe this proves God has permanently rejected them rather than it being a temporary punishment as in the Old Testament?

2. How can you claim that God would never punish His true people indefinitely when the Bible itself records centuries of Israelite captivity and exile?

3. Why do you think the Jews’ failure to see their suffering as proof of rejection blinds them, while Christians are able to interpret the same history correctly?

5. How do you justify saying that Jews are raised from childhood with “venom” against Jesus and the Trinity?

6. If both Jews and Christians claim descent from Abraham, why do you say Jewish boasting in their ancestry is false pride but Christian spiritual descent from Abraham is valid?

7. Why do you call the traditional Jewish blessing thanking God “for not making me a Gentile… or a woman” blasphemous and pagan?

8. When the Old Testament prophets condemned Israel’s arrogance in lineage, were they rejecting Jewish identity itself or only sinful pride?

9. You cite John the Baptist calling the Jews a “brood of vipers” for trusting in Abraham’s lineage—does this mean physical descent from Abraham has no value at all?

10. When Jesus told the Jews “you are of your father the devil,” was He denying that Jews are Abraham’s descendants, or condemning their actions?

17. If all flesh is condemned by birth, as you say, then how were the patriarchs themselves righteous before the coming of Christ?

18. You use Esau and Jacob as proof that equal birth means nothing—yet doesn’t God’s choice of Jacob over Esau show election, not rejection of blood entirely?

19. If Ishmael was Abraham’s son yet rejected, does that mean God rejects all non-Jewish descendants of Abraham forever?

20. If Gentiles also descend from the patriarchs (through Esau, Ishmael, etc.), why do you say Jews have no exclusive right to boast—yet still treat Jewish identity as false?

21. You say no one can be God’s people by birth—then how were the Israelites God’s people for 1,500 years before Christ?

23. You mock Jewish circumcision because Muslims also practice it—does that make the original biblical command worthless?

24. Why do you call the Jewish custom of more painful circumcision rites a “devilish addition” to God’s command?

25. If the prophets demanded circumcision of the heart, does that mean physical circumcision was always meant to be temporary?

26. When God says through Jeremiah that circumcised Jews with uncircumcised hearts are no better than heathen, is He abolishing Jewish identity or calling for repentance?

30. You accuse Jews of “spiritually murdering” the prophets with false glosses—yet don’t Christians also interpret the same prophets differently?

32. Why do you say possessing the Law actually damns the Jews more because they disobey it?

33. You say Jews boast in the Law while practicing usury and other vices—were there no pious Jews who kept the Law?

34. When you compare Jewish ceremonial law without morality to a whore pretending to be a virgin, are you saying the entire Judaism is hypocrisy?

35. If Jews have “uncircumcised hearts” despite physical rites, why did God continue to deal with Israel for centuries after the prophets’ warnings?

36. You say having God’s word without obeying it makes the Jews worse than devils—yet doesn’t the New Testament say the same could apply to disobedient Christians?

38. If the temple was destroyed and the land lost because of disobedience, why do Christians say the Old Covenant is fulfilled rather than abolished?
