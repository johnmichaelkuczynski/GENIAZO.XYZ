BERTRAND RUSSELL POSITION STATEMENTS 

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE ANALYSIS OF MATTER (1927)

1. Physics tells us only about the structure of the physical world, not about its intrinsic nature.

2. Our knowledge of the external world is entirely structural or relational, never qualitative.

3. Events, not substances or particles, are the fundamental constituents of the physical world.

4. Percepts are a subset of the events that constitute the brain.

5. Naive realism is false: our percepts do not directly reveal the intrinsic qualities of external objects.

6. The only things we know non-inferentially are our own percepts and their qualities.

7. Physical objects are logical constructions out of events.

8. Causation is to be understood in terms of functional relations between events, not as a metaphysical power.

9. The distinction between mind and matter is not fundamental but reflects different causal arrangements of neutral events.

10. What physics describes as matter is really groups of events connected by causal laws.

11. Space-time structure is knowable through physics, but the intrinsic character of what occupies space-time is not.

12. Inference from percepts to their external causes is justified by the principle of causal continuity.

13. The qualities we directly experience (colors, sounds, etc.) exist only in percepts, not in external objects.

14. Physical space and perceptual space are distinct; physics deals only with the former.

15. The electron and other theoretical entities are logical fictions constructed from groups of events.

16. The causal theory of perception is the correct account of how we perceive external objects.

17. All empirical knowledge of the world beyond our percepts depends on causal inference.

18. The "matter" of physics is far more abstract than common sense supposes.

19. There is no good reason to believe that physical objects have any intrinsic nature beyond their structural properties.

20. The world described by physics is not the world of everyday experience but a mathematical abstraction.

21. Neutral monism provides a more economical ontology than either materialism or idealism.

22. Mind and brain are different aspects of the same underlying neutral events.

23. The only intrinsic qualities we know are the qualities of our own mental states.

24. Modern physics (relativity and quantum mechanics) supports a structural rather than substantival view of matter.

25. Space and time are not independent realities but aspects of the relations among events.

26. Perception involves a causal chain from external object to brain event, and the percept occurs at the end of that chain.

27. We cannot know whether the intrinsic nature of external events resembles the intrinsic nature of our percepts.

28. The common-sense distinction between "real" and "apparent" properties cannot be maintained.

29. Scientific inference from percepts to physics requires assuming that similar structures have similar causes.

30. The physical world is not directly observable; all observation is of percepts.

31. Traditional materialism errs in ascribing to matter qualities that belong only to percepts.

32. Physical objects do not have color, sound, smell, or any secondary qualities in themselves.

33. The brain is part of the physical world, and mental events are identical with certain brain events.

34. Our knowledge of physics is hypothetical knowledge about structure, confirmed by its predictive success.

35. The distinction between physics and psychology is a difference in the causal laws studied, not in the entities involved.

36. All that physics can legitimately assert about matter is its mathematical-structural properties.

37. The continuity of nature suggests that the intrinsic character of events outside brains is not wholly unlike percepts.

38. There is no dualistic gap between mind and matter because both reduce to events.

39. Substance is a metaphysical illusion; what exists is patterns of events.

40. The inference from percepts to external causes is probabilistic, not demonstrative.

41. Scientific realism must be reformulated as structural realism rather than naive realism about theoretical entities.

42. Quantum mechanics reveals that the classical picture of determinate particles is false.

43. The physical world is a four-dimensional manifold of events related by causal laws.

44. Perception gives us direct knowledge only of the terminus of a causal process, not of its origin.

45. The principle of spatiotemporal continuity in causation underwrites inference from effect to cause.

46. Mental causation is a species of physical causation involving brain events.

47. Epistemological dualism (between percepts and objects) does not entail ontological dualism (between mind and matter).

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE ANALYSIS OF MIND (1921)

1. Mind and matter are both logical constructions out of a neutral stuff that is neither mental nor physical in itself.

2. Consciousness is not a unique substance or entity but a particular arrangement of neutral elements.

3. Sensations are the intersection point where physics and psychology meet; they belong to both domains.

4. Introspection is not a separate faculty revealing a private mental realm but simply attention directed at certain events.

5. The subject or ego is not a substantive entity but a logical fiction constructed from experiences.

6. Belief is a quality of certain mental occurrences, not a relation between a mind and a proposition.

7. Desire is to be analyzed in terms of behavior and discomfort cycles, not as a primitive mental act.

8. Images differ from sensations in their causes and effects, not in their intrinsic nature.

9. Memory is not direct acquaintance with the past but present images accompanied by a feeling of pastness.

10. Meaning is constituted by the causal relations between words and what they signify, not by mental acts of meaning.

11. Words acquire meaning through association with objects and situations, not through private definitions.

12. Thought can occur without language, though language greatly extends its scope and precision.

13. There is no act of consciousness distinct from its objects; consciousness is adverbial, not substantival.

14. The traditional distinction between mental acts and their contents is spurious.

15. Behaviorism is partially correct: much of what we call mental can be analyzed in behavioral terms.

16. Behaviorism is partially incorrect: it cannot account for images, which are genuine mental particulars.

17. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to present sensations and images.

18. Knowledge of the external world and other minds is entirely inferential.

19. Propositions are not entities; what exists are propositional attitudes, which are complex psychological facts.

20. Imagination consists of images that are copies of past sensations, operating under different causal laws.

21. The distinction between true and false beliefs lies in their correspondence or non-correspondence with facts.

22. Emotions are complex states involving sensations, images, and bodily feelings.

23. Will is not a special faculty but desire plus belief that action will achieve the desired end.

24. Habit, not reason, governs most human behavior.

25. Instinct is inherited habit, modified by experience but not created by it.

26. Perception is not passive reception but active construction involving inference and interpretation.

27. The "self" is a series of experiences connected by memory and causal continuity, not a persisting substance.

28. There is no pure ego or transcendental subject underlying experience.

29. Mental events are distinguished from physical events by their causal laws, not by their intrinsic nature.

30. Mnemic causation (where past events influence present behavior without intermediate links) is fundamental to psychology.

31. Association of ideas is a real psychological law but does not fully explain the structure of thought.

32. Attention is selective response, not a special mental power directed by a homunculus.

33. Pleasure and pain are qualities of sensations, not separate mental entities.

34. The "intentionality" of mental states (their aboutness) reduces to causal and associative relations.

35. Language is a social phenomenon; meaning is public, not private.

36. Understanding a word consists in having appropriate images or behavioral responses associated with it.

37. General ideas are not abstract entities but habits of response to similarities among particulars.

38. Judgment is a complex of sensations, images, and feelings, not a unique mental act relating a mind to a proposition.

39. Truth is a property of beliefs, consisting in their correspondence with facts.

40. Facts are not propositions but arrangements of particulars that make propositions true or false.

41. The unconscious exists: mental causation can occur without conscious awareness.

42. Dreams are wish-fulfillments, as Freud claimed, though his specific theories require modification.

43. The analysis of mind requires both introspective and behavioral data; neither alone suffices.

44. Physics and psychology study the same neutral events from different perspectives and with different groupings.

45. There are no purely mental substances; the mind is a construction out of events that also constitute the body.

46. Personal identity over time is a matter of degree, not an all-or-nothing affair.

47. The feeling of familiarity is a distinct mental quality that can attach to any object of experience.

48. Vagueness is essential to most thought and language; precision is the exception, not the rule.

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS (1903)

1. Pure mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form "p implies q" where p and q contain only logical constants and variables.

2. Mathematics and logic are identical; mathematics is simply logic developed to a higher degree.

3. All mathematical concepts can be defined in terms of purely logical concepts.

4. All mathematical truths can be derived from purely logical axioms.

5. The natural numbers can be defined as classes of similar classes.

6. Zero is the class of all empty classes.

7. One is the class of all unit classes.

8. A cardinal number is the class of all classes similar (equinumerous) to a given class.

9. Similarity between classes is defined by the existence of a one-to-one correspondence.

10. The successor relation among numbers is definable in purely logical terms.

11. Mathematical induction is derivable from the definition of natural numbers, not an independent axiom.

12. Infinity is a logical possibility and presents no inherent contradiction.

13. The actual infinite exists in mathematics; potential infinity is an inadequate substitute.

14. Fractions and real numbers can be constructed from natural numbers using logical operations.

15. Real numbers are best defined as segments (Dedekind cuts) of the rational number series.

16. Continuity is a property of series, definable without appeal to intuition.

17. The calculus can be made rigorous through the arithmetization of analysis; infinitesimals are eliminable.

18. Limits involve no metaphysical notion of "approaching"; they are definable in static terms.

19. Geometry is a branch of pure mathematics when studied abstractly, apart from physical space.

20. Projective geometry is more fundamental than metric geometry.

21. Space as studied by geometry is not necessarily physical space.

22. Different geometries (Euclidean, non-Euclidean) are equally consistent; which describes physical space is empirical.

23. Points, lines, and planes are logical constructions, not intuited simples.

24. Order is a fundamental logical concept not reducible to anything simpler.

25. Asymmetrical relations are essential to mathematics and cannot be eliminated.

26. Relations are as fundamental as classes; neither can be reduced to the other.

27. A relation-in-intension is distinct from the class of ordered pairs that constitutes its extension.

28. Serial order depends on transitive, asymmetrical, and connected relations.

29. The concept of "between" is fundamental to the theory of order.

30. Dense series (between any two terms there is another) are central to analysis.

31. Compact series and continuous series must be carefully distinguished.

32. Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers is logically sound and mathematically indispensable.

33. There are different sizes of infinity; some infinite sets are larger than others.

34. The power set of any set has greater cardinality than the original set.

35. The continuum is larger than the set of natural numbers (uncountably infinite).

36. Ordinal numbers differ from cardinal numbers and are essential for well-ordered sets.

37. A well-ordered set is one in which every non-empty subset has a least element.

38. The theory of types is needed to avoid logical contradictions.

39. Classes and individuals belong to different logical types.

40. No class can be a member of itself without generating contradiction.

41. The class of all classes is an illegitimate totality.

42. Propositions about "all propositions" must be interpreted with care to avoid paradox.

43. Russell's paradox (the class of all classes not members of themselves) shows naive set theory is inconsistent.

44. Denoting concepts are essential to understanding how general propositions work.

45. "All," "some," "any," and "the" function differently and must be carefully distinguished.

46. Definite descriptions ("the so-and-so") denote even when nothing satisfies them (in a sense).

47. Propositional functions are more fundamental than propositions.

48. A propositional function becomes a proposition when a value is assigned to its variable.

49. Variables range over types; unrestricted variables lead to paradox.

50. Implication is the fundamental logical relation from which others are derivable.

51. Material implication differs from formal implication (which involves variables).

52. Logical constants include implication, negation, disjunction, and the notion of a propositional function.

53. Propositions are objective entities, not mental acts or sentences.

54. True and false are indefinable properties of propositions.

55. Facts are complexes consisting of terms united by relations.

56. Every proposition is either true or false (bivalence holds).

57. Identity is a relation, though a peculiar one that holds only between a thing and itself.

58. Classes are logical fictions; talk of classes is reducible to talk of propositional functions.

59. The null class exists and is unique.

60. The universal class for a given type includes all entities of that type.

61. Class membership and class inclusion are fundamentally different relations.

62. Arithmetic can be derived entirely from logic without appeal to intuition.

63. Peano's axioms for arithmetic can be proven from logical definitions.

64. Addition is definable as an operation on cardinal numbers without appeal to intuition.

65. Multiplication is definable logically in terms of one-many relations.

66. Exponentiation is the number of ways of correlating two classes.

67. Subtraction and division are not always possible within the natural numbers; this motivates extensions.

68. Negative numbers and rationals are constructed as ordered pairs of natural numbers.

69. Zero and one are not successive in any metaphysically deep sense; their relation is logical.

70. Mathematical existence means logical consistency; no other existence is required.

71. Existence in mathematics is not spatio-temporal existence.

72. Definitions in mathematics are always explicit; implicit definition is a confusion.

73. Axioms are not self-evident truths but primitive propositions from which others follow.

74. The choice of axioms is partly conventional but constrained by logical requirements.

75. Proof in mathematics is deduction from axioms and definitions using logical rules.

76. Symbolic logic is an essential tool for achieving rigor in mathematics.

77. Ordinary language is systematically misleading about logical form.

78. The subject-predicate form of ordinary grammar does not reveal logical structure.

79. Relational propositions cannot be reduced to subject-predicate form.

80. Plurality is a fundamental logical concept; monism about relations is false.

81. External relations are real; not all relations are reducible to properties of their terms.

82. Bradley's regress against relations fails; relations are genuine constituents of facts.

83. Wholes are not always prior to their parts; logical atomism is defensible.

84. Analysis does not falsify; complex entities are genuinely composed of simpler ones.

85. The part-whole relation differs from set membership and must not be confused with it.

86. Extensive magnitude is analyzable in terms of the part-whole relation.

87. Intensive magnitude presents philosophical difficulties not fully resolved by logic alone.

88. Motion is analyzable as a function from times to positions; Zeno's paradoxes are soluble.

89. Zeno's paradoxes rest on confusions about infinity and continuity that modern analysis resolves.

90. Time, like space, can be represented by a continuous series of instants.

91. Instants are logical constructions from events or other temporal relations.

92. Change is analyzable as different properties at different times; no contradiction arises.

93. Causation is not a logical relation; it is not part of pure mathematics.

94. Necessity in mathematics is logical necessity, not causal or metaphysical necessity.

95. Modality (possibility, necessity) in mathematics reduces to consistency and derivability.

96. Nominalism about universals is false; relations and properties are genuine entities.

97. Universals exist independently of their instances; Platonism about mathematical objects is correct.

98. Classes, numbers, and relations are abstract objects with genuine being.

99. Philosophy must use the methods of logic and analysis, not speculation or intuition.

100. The foundations of mathematics require philosophical clarification that only logic can provide.


POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE ANALYSIS OF MIND (1921) [CONTINUED]

49. The word "mental" should be defined by the causal laws governing certain events, not by reference to a special substance.

50. Cognition is not a unique relation between mind and object but a complex of causally connected events.

51. The "given" in experience is not raw sensation but already contains interpretive elements.

52. Perception involves habits built up from past experience that shape how we respond to stimuli.

53. There is no sharp boundary between perception and hallucination; both are causally explicable.

54. The external reference of sensations is not intrinsic to them but added by belief and habit.

55. Sensations do not inherently point beyond themselves to external objects; this reference is constructed.

56. Images can be mistaken for sensations, particularly in cases of vivid imagination or hallucination.

57. The privacy of mental life is exaggerated; much of what we call private is publicly inferrable.

58. Other minds are known by analogy with our own case, supported by behavioral evidence.

59. Animals possess minds in the same sense humans do; the difference is one of degree, not kind.

60. Infant minds develop through the gradual organization of initially chaotic sensations.

61. Expectation is a present mental state with future reference, analyzable without postulating future entities.

62. Surprise occurs when expectations built from habit are violated by present sensation.

63. Recognition is a present feeling, not a comparison between present perception and stored memory image.

64. The feeling of knowing differs from actual knowledge; one can feel certain yet be wrong.

65. Concepts are not abstract objects grasped by intellect but habits of using words similarly.

66. Abstract ideas are verbal habits, not mental pictures of general qualities.

67. The meaning of a word is not an image but the entire system of reactions the word produces.

68. Sentences, not words, are the primary units of meaning.

69. A word in isolation has only "dictionary meaning"; full meaning requires sentential context.

70. Logical words ("not," "or," "all") cannot be understood through images; their meaning is functional.

71. Propositional attitudes differ in their behavioral and physiological manifestations, not in relating to different abstract entities.

72. Doubt is a genuine mental state distinct from both belief and disbelief.

73. Questioning is a mental state with its own distinctive feeling-tone and behavioral expression.

74. Error arises from treating images as sensations or from inappropriate habitual inferences.

75. Negative facts do not exist; negation is a feature of propositions and beliefs, not of reality.

76. True beliefs are those whose behavioral consequences succeed; false beliefs lead to surprise and frustration.

77. Inference is primarily a process of habit, not a conscious application of logical rules.

78. Reasoning is serial association constrained by habitual patterns of connection.

79. Logic describes ideal inference; psychology describes actual inference, which often departs from the ideal.

80. Instinct is modified by experience much more readily in humans than in lower animals.

81. The greater plasticity of human instinct explains the greater role of learning in human life.

82. Imitation is a fundamental mechanism by which habits spread through a community.

83. Sympathy is the tendency to feel emotions similar to those we perceive in others.

84. Social feeling develops from primitive sympathy modified by experience and habit.

85. Language is the primary vehicle by which individual experience becomes social.

86. Thought without language is imagistic and imprecise; language makes abstract thought possible.

87. Inner speech (verbal imagery) is central to adult human cognition.

88. Children think in images before they think in words; verbal thought is a later development.

89. The meaning of a word for an individual depends on that individual's history of associations.

90. Definitions in ordinary language differ from definitions in logic; the former are always somewhat vague.

91. Vague beliefs can be true; precision is not required for truth.

92. Emotional associations attach to words and color our beliefs about what the words denote.

93. Propaganda works by exploiting the emotional associations of words rather than their cognitive content.

94. Desire is essentially connected with discomfort and the activity aimed at removing it.

95. The object of desire is often unknown to the desiring subject until satisfaction is achieved.

96. Purpose is analyzable in terms of desire and belief without postulating a separate faculty of will.

97. Pleasure accompanies the satisfaction of desire; it is not itself the object of desire.

98. Displeasure accompanies the frustration of desire and drives behavior aimed at alleviating it.

99. The James-Lange theory of emotion is substantially correct: emotions are largely constituted by bodily feelings.

100. Fear, anger, and other emotions are best understood as patterns of bodily sensation plus behavioral tendency.

101. Consciousness admits of degrees; there is no sharp line between conscious and unconscious processes.

102. The unconscious influences behavior through habits and associations of which we are unaware.

103. Forgetting is not the destruction of memory traces but the inhibition of their influence.

104. Repression is a real phenomenon; some memories are actively prevented from influencing consciousness.

105. The "censor" of psychoanalysis can be understood in terms of conflicting habit systems.

106. Dreams draw on desires that are suppressed during waking life.

107. The apparent irrationality of dreams reflects the loosening of habitual constraints on association.

108. Sleep reduces the influence of present sensation, allowing memory and imagination freer play.

109. Attention involves the selective enhancement of certain stimuli and the inhibition of others.

110. Concentration is sustained attention maintained by interest or effort.

111. Fatigue in mental work is primarily fatigue of attention, not of any cognitive faculty.

112. The stream of consciousness is not a single unified flow but a complex of interacting processes.

113. The feeling of activity is a genuine component of experience, accompanying effortful mental work.

114. Conation (striving) is a real feature of mental life, not reducible to mere sensation.

115. The self is not the cause of mental processes but their result; it is constructed, not given.

116. Self-consciousness is awareness of certain mental events, not awareness of a substantial ego.

117. The unity of mind is functional, not substantial; it consists in the integration of habits.

118. Split personality cases show that the unity of mind can break down; it is not metaphysically guaranteed.

119. Personal identity is constituted by memory continuity and bodily continuity, not by a soul.

120. Death is the termination of the causal series that constitutes a mind; no further existence is implied.

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE ANALYSIS OF MIND (1921) [CONTINUED]

121. Sensations are caused by stimuli external to the nervous system; images are caused by processes within it.

122. The distinction between sensation and image is causal, not introspectively infallible.

123. Centrally-caused images and peripherally-caused sensations may be qualitatively indistinguishable.

124. Hallucinations are images mistaken for sensations due to their abnormal vividness or context.

125. The prototype of all images is the memory image, which copies past sensation.

126. Imagination operates by recombining elements derived from past sensations.

127. Creative imagination does not produce genuinely new elements but only novel combinations.

128. The laws of association (contiguity, similarity) govern the sequence of images in thought.

129. Association by contiguity is the fundamental law; association by similarity derives from it.

130. Similarity itself is not a simple relation but depends on partial identity of constituents.

131. Conditioned reflexes (Pavlov) illustrate the mechanism of association in its simplest form.

132. Learning is the modification of behavior through the formation of new associative connections.

133. Knowledge of universals reduces to the habit of responding similarly to similar particulars.

134. There are no abstract ideas over and above particular images used in a general way.

135. Berkeley was right that all ideas are particular; he erred in thinking this undermines general knowledge.

136. Generality resides in the use of an image, not in any intrinsic property of the image itself.

137. Words can function as substitutes for images, serving the same role in thought.

138. Much adult thought proceeds via words alone, without accompanying imagery.

139. Verbal thinking is more precise and controllable than imagistic thinking.

140. The behaviorist can explain verbal behavior but not the images that accompany it.

141. Images are the chief evidence against pure behaviorism as a complete psychology.

142. Introspective reports are behavioral data; they do not give privileged access to a private realm.

143. What introspection reports is influenced by theory and expectation; it is not infallible.

144. The existence of images is established by their causal efficacy, not by introspective certainty.

145. After-images prove that sensory experience can occur without external stimuli.

146. Eidetic imagery in some individuals shows that images can have sensory vividness.

147. The difference between imagining and perceiving lies in causal context, not phenomenal quality.

148. Beliefs are true when they are suitably related to facts that would verify them.

149. Verification is the behavioral test by which true and false beliefs are distinguished.

150. The pragmatic theory of truth captures something important but must be refined.

151. Truth is not constituted by usefulness but is reliably correlated with it.

152. False beliefs tend to produce actions that fail, which is why truth matters practically.

153. The correspondence theory of truth is correct but must be stated in terms of structural isomorphism.

154. A belief corresponds to a fact when there is a structural similarity between belief-components and fact-components.

155. Facts are not propositions but complexes of particulars in relation.

156. Negative propositions are made true by positive facts plus the non-existence of certain other facts.

157. General propositions are made true by conjunctions of particular facts.

158. Existence-propositions assert that a propositional function is sometimes true.

159. Knowledge is a species of belief but requires additional conditions beyond truth.

160. Knowledge requires appropriate causal connection between belief and fact.

161. True belief accidentally arrived at does not constitute knowledge.

162. Degrees of belief are psychologically real and influence behavior accordingly.

163. Assertion expresses a high degree of belief; questioning expresses suspended belief.

164. Memory-knowledge is as direct as any knowledge can be, though not infallible.

165. The pastness of a remembered event is not a relation we perceive but a quality we feel.

166. Memory can be mistaken about whether an event occurred, not just about its details.

167. Deja vu illustrates that the feeling of familiarity can attach to genuinely novel experiences.

168. Recognition-memory differs from recall; one can recognize without being able to recall.

169. Habit-memory (knowing how) differs from explicit memory (knowing that).

170. Skills are retained in habit-memory even when explicit memory of learning them is lost.

171. The past is not directly present to memory; what is present is a present image with past reference.

172. The reference to the past is constituted by belief, not by any intrinsic feature of the memory-image.

173. Expectation involves present imagery with future reference, structured analogously to memory.

174. The future-reference of expectation is also constituted by belief attached to present images.

175. Temporal orientation (past, present, future) is imposed on experience by belief, not directly sensed.

176. The specious present is the span of time experienced as "now," varying with attention and context.

177. Succession within the specious present is directly experienced; succession beyond it is inferred.

178. The feeling of duration is a genuine datum, though judgments of duration are often inaccurate.

179. Time perception depends on rhythm, change, and the fullness or emptiness of experienced content.

180. Boredom lengthens experienced time; interest shortens it.

181. Perception is never instantaneous; it always occupies a finite span of the specious present.

182. The construction of objective time from experienced temporal relations is a logical achievement.

183. Temporal relations in physics are inferred from, not directly given in, experience.

184. The privacy of temporal experience contrasts with the publicity of physical time.

185. Spatial perception is constructed from sensory cues interpreted through habit.

186. The correlation of visual, tactile, and kinaesthetic data creates the perception of external space.

187. Depth perception is learned, not innate; it results from experience with movement and touch.

188. The thing seen and the thing touched are identified through habitual correlation, not direct perception.

189. Perceptual constancy (size, shape, color) results from habitual interpretation, not raw sensation.

190. We perceive things, not sensations; sensations are discovered by subsequent analysis.

191. Common sense objects are logical constructions from sensory particulars.

192. The common sense world is a pragmatic construction useful for action, not a metaphysical given.

193. Science reconstructs the common sense world using inferences from sensory data.

194. Neither common sense nor science gives the ultimate reality; both are constructions.

195. Philosophy must analyze constructions to discover the elements from which they are built.

196. The method of logical analysis reveals the structure hidden beneath ordinary speech and thought.

197. Analysis does not destroy its object but clarifies its components and relations.

198. Synthesis from analyzed elements recreates the original whole with added understanding.

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS (1903) [CONTINUED]

101. The notion of "class" is fundamental to mathematics and cannot be defined in terms of anything more primitive.

102. A class is wholly determined by its members; classes with the same members are identical.

103. The null class is not nothing; it is a genuine class that happens to have no members.

104. The class of all entities is a legitimate notion within any single type but not across types.

105. Intensional and extensional definitions of classes must be carefully distinguished.

106. Two propositional functions may be materially equivalent yet intensionally distinct.

107. The extension of a propositional function is the class of arguments satisfying it.

108. Predicates do not name classes; the relation between predicate and class is indirect.

109. Not every grammatical predicate corresponds to a genuine propositional function.

110. Self-referential propositional functions must be excluded to avoid paradox.

111. The hierarchy of types applies to propositional functions as well as to classes.

112. A propositional function cannot take itself as argument without type violation.

113. Quantification ("all," "some") ranges over a determinate type, not over everything whatsoever.

114. Unrestricted quantification leads to the paradoxes that afflict naive logic.

115. The theory of types is the only known solution to the logical paradoxes.

116. The vicious circle principle forbids defining an entity in terms of a totality containing it.

117. Impredicative definitions are those violating the vicious circle principle and must be rejected.

118. The ancestral relation (transitive closure) is definable in purely logical terms.

119. Mathematical induction is a consequence of defining natural numbers via the ancestral of succession.

120. Finite and infinite are definable without appeal to intuition or counting.

121. A class is infinite if and only if it is similar to a proper subclass of itself (Dedekind's definition).

122. Finite classes cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with proper subclasses.

123. The axiom of infinity asserts the existence of at least one infinite class.

124. Whether the axiom of infinity is a logical truth is uncertain; it may be an empirical hypothesis.

125. The existence of infinite classes cannot be proven from pure logic alone.

126. Denumerable infinity (aleph-null) is the smallest infinite cardinal.

127. The rational numbers are denumerable; they can be counted by the natural numbers.

128. The real numbers are non-denumerable; no enumeration can exhaust them.

129. Cantor's diagonal argument proves the non-denumerability of the continuum.

130. The power of the continuum exceeds the power of the natural numbers.

131. Whether there is an intermediate infinity between aleph-null and the continuum is undecided (continuum hypothesis).

132. Ordinal arithmetic differs from cardinal arithmetic; order matters for ordinals.

133. The ordinal of the natural numbers is omega, the first transfinite ordinal.

134. Ordinals beyond omega are generated by the successor operation and limit operations.

135. Well-ordering is essential to the theory of ordinals; not all sets can be well-ordered without the axiom of choice.

136. The axiom of choice asserts that for any collection of non-empty sets, a selection function exists.

137. The axiom of choice is independent of the other axioms; its status is philosophically controversial.

138. Multiplicative axiom and axiom of choice are equivalent formulations of the same principle.

139. Many important mathematical theorems depend on the axiom of choice.

140. Zermelo's well-ordering theorem follows from the axiom of choice.

141. The theory of selections and the theory of relations are intimately connected.

142. A relation is asymmetric if it never holds both ways between distinct terms.

143. A relation is transitive if whenever it holds from a to b and b to c, it holds from a to c.

144. A relation is connected if for any two distinct terms, it holds one way or the other.

145. Serial relations are transitive, asymmetric, and connected.

146. Every series determines an order among its terms.

147. Two series are similar if there is a one-one relation preserving order between them.

148. The ordinal number of a series is what all similar series have in common.

149. Between any two rational numbers there is another; the rationals are dense.

150. The real numbers fill the "gaps" among the rationals; they are continuous.

151. Dedekind's definition of continuity requires that every cut determines a real number.

152. Cantor's definition of continuity involves limits of sequences.

153. The two definitions of continuity are equivalent for the real number system.

154. Compact series are those where between any two terms there is a third; density plus other conditions.

155. Continuous series satisfy compactness plus Dedekind's cut condition.

156. The order type of the rational numbers is called eta.

157. The order type of the real numbers is called theta.

158. Distinct well-ordered series with the same ordinal number are similar.

159. Not every dense series is continuous; the rationals are dense but not continuous.

160. Limits are definable in terms of segments and their boundary elements.

161. The notion of limit involves no reference to motion or temporal approach.

162. Weierstrass's arithmetization of analysis eliminates geometric and kinetic intuitions.

163. Infinitesimals are logically unnecessary; limits accomplish all that infinitesimals were supposed to do.

164. The calculus is entirely explicable in terms of the theory of limits and real numbers.

165. Derivatives are limits of difference quotients, not ratios of infinitesimals.

166. Integrals are limits of sums, not sums of infinitely small quantities.

167. Continuous functions are those where small changes in input produce small changes in output.

168. Uniform continuity differs from pointwise continuity and is required for some theorems.

169. A function is a many-one relation assigning to each argument exactly one value.

170. Functions are not processes or operations but static correlations.

171. The domain of a function is the class of arguments; the range is the class of values.

172. Composition of functions is itself a function; functions are closed under composition.

173. Inverse functions exist only for one-one functions.

174. The identity function leaves every argument unchanged.

175. Functions can take functions as arguments; this generates a hierarchy of function types.

176. Predicative functions are those definable without reference to totalities of functions.

177. The ramified theory of types classifies functions by their order as well as their type.

178. Reducibility axiom asserts that every function is equivalent to a predicative function.

179. The reducibility axiom is philosophically dubious but mathematically convenient.

180. Arithmetic is independent of geometry; numbers do not depend on spatial intuition.

181. Geometry without arithmetic is possible; relational structures suffice.

182. The parallel postulate is independent of the other Euclidean axioms.

183. Non-Euclidean geometries are consistent if Euclidean geometry is consistent.

184. Which geometry describes physical space is an empirical, not a priori, question.

185. Pure geometry studies abstract structures; applied geometry studies physical space.

186. Metric geometry presupposes projective geometry; distance is definable projectively.

187. Projective geometry is the most fundamental form of geometry.

188. Descriptive geometry deals with order and betweenness without metrical notions.

189. Topology studies properties invariant under continuous deformation.

190. Dimensionality is a topological invariant; a line cannot be continuously mapped onto a plane bijectively.

191. Points may be defined as classes of nested volumes or as limits of convergent sequences.

192. Lines may be defined as classes of points satisfying certain order relations.

193. Planes and higher-dimensional spaces are constructed analogously.

194. Space is relational, not substantial; it consists of relations among objects.

195. Absolute space (Newton) and absolute motion are metaphysically indefensible.

196. Motion is change of spatial relations over time.

197. Zeno's dichotomy paradox is resolved by the mathematical theory of convergent series.

198. Zeno's Achilles paradox confuses the infinite number of steps with infinite time.

199. Zeno's arrow paradox confuses instantaneous velocity with lack of motion.

200. Zeno's stadium paradox rests on confusion about relative and absolute motion.

POSITION STATEMENTS: RUSSELL - THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS (1903) [CONTINUED]

201. The concept of magnitude is distinct from the concept of number; magnitudes may be non-numerical.

202. Extensive magnitudes have parts that are themselves magnitudes of the same kind.

203. Intensive magnitudes (like temperature or brightness) admit of degree but not of spatial addition.

204. Measurement assigns numbers to magnitudes by comparing them with a unit.

205. The choice of unit is arbitrary; what is objective is the ratio between magnitudes.

206. Equal magnitudes are those bearing the same ratio to the unit.

207. Comparison of magnitudes presupposes a serial order among them.

208. Not all magnitudes are commensurable; incommensurables require the theory of real numbers.

209. The discovery of incommensurables by the Greeks was a crisis for ancient mathematics.

210. Dedekind's theory of cuts resolves the problem of incommensurables rigorously.

211. Quantity and quality are not contradictory; qualities may vary in degree.

212. The distinction between quantity and quality is not absolute but relative to context.

213. Counting presupposes the ability to distinguish units and to correlate them one-to-one.

214. The act of counting is psychological; the numbers counted are not.

215. Numbers are discovered, not invented; they are independent of mental acts.

216. Nominalism about numbers is refuted by the objectivity of mathematical truth.

217. Psychologism in logic confuses the laws of thought with the laws of valid inference.

218. Logic is normative for thought but not constituted by thought.

219. The laws of logic hold independently of whether anyone thinks them.

220. Logical truths are true in all possible worlds; they have maximum generality.

221. Logical constants are topic-neutral; they apply to all subject matters.

222. Material implication is the weakest form of implication; it requires only truth-value connection.

223. Strict implication would require necessary connection, but necessity is problematic.

224. Paradoxes of material implication are merely counterintuitive, not genuinely paradoxical.

225. A false proposition materially implies any proposition; this is logically correct if odd.

226. A true proposition is materially implied by any proposition; equally correct and odd.

227. Formal implication generalizes material implication over all values of a variable.

228. "All A are B" is a formal implication: for all x, if x is A then x is B.

229. The existential import of universal propositions is zero; "all unicorns are white" is vacuously true.

230. Particular propositions ("some A are B") do have existential import.

231. The traditional square of opposition must be revised in light of modern logic.

232. Subalternation fails when the universal is vacuously true but the particular requires existence.

233. Contraposition is valid for material implication: if p implies q, then not-q implies not-p.

234. Transposition (contraposition) is a fundamental inference rule.

235. Modus ponens is the fundamental rule of detachment: from p and p-implies-q, infer q.

236. Modus tollens follows from modus ponens plus contraposition.

237. Hypothetical syllogism chains implications: if p implies q and q implies r, then p implies r.

238. Disjunctive syllogism allows inference from "p or q" and "not p" to q.

239. Disjunction in logic is inclusive: "p or q" is true if either or both are true.

240. Exclusive disjunction is definable from inclusive disjunction and negation.

241. Conjunction is true only when both conjuncts are true.

242. Negation reverses truth value; double negation returns the original value.

243. The law of excluded middle holds: every proposition is either true or false.

244. The law of non-contradiction holds: no proposition is both true and false.

245. These laws are not psychological generalizations but logical necessities.

246. Logical necessity is distinct from causal necessity; logic does not depend on natural law.

247. Logical truths are analytic; they are true in virtue of meaning alone.

248. The analytic-synthetic distinction is fundamental to understanding mathematics.

249. Mathematical truths are analytic, not synthetic a priori as Kant held.

250. Kant was wrong that mathematics requires pure intuition; logic suffices.

251. Arithmetic does not depend on the intuition of time, contra Kant.

252. Geometry does not depend on the intuition of space when considered purely formally.

253. The synthetic a priori is an unnecessary hypothesis; logicism eliminates it.

254. Mill was wrong that mathematical truths are empirical generalizations.

255. Mathematical necessity cannot be explained by habitual association.

256. The certainty of mathematics exceeds that of any empirical science.

257. Mathematical truths are known a priori, though the process of discovery may be empirical.

258. Discovery is psychological; justification is logical—the two must not be confused.

259. Axioms are not self-evident starting points but propositions chosen for their deductive fertility.

260. Different axiomatizations of the same theory may be equally legitimate.

261. The primitives of a theory are those notions not defined within the theory.

262. Some notions must be taken as primitive to avoid infinite regress of definitions.

263. Definition is the introduction of a new symbol as shorthand for a complex expression.

264. Definitions are theoretically eliminable; they add convenience, not content.

265. Real definitions (of things) differ from nominal definitions (of words).

266. Mathematics deals primarily with nominal definitions; real definitions are philosophical.

267. Philosophical analysis seeks real definitions of fundamental concepts.

268. Analysis terminates in indefinables known by acquaintance.

269. Logical constants are among the indefinables; they cannot be further analyzed.

270. The concept of "term" is the most general concept; everything thinkable is a term.

271. Terms include things, concepts, relations, propositions, and classes.

272. Every term has being; not every term has existence (spatio-temporal location).

273. Being is wider than existence; numbers have being but do not exist in space and time.

274. The distinction between being and existence is metaphysically fundamental.

275. Existence in the logical sense means being the value of a variable satisfying a propositional function.

276. "There exists an x such that..." is the existential quantifier.

277. The existential quantifier is definable in terms of the universal quantifier and negation.

278. The universal quantifier is not a conjunction; it applies even to infinite domains.

279. Quantifiers bind variables; a bound variable is not a name.

280. Free variables make a proposition into a propositional function.

281. The substitution of constants for free variables yields a determinate proposition.

282. The scope of a quantifier must be precisely delimited to avoid ambiguity.

283. Scope distinctions resolve many apparent puzzles about quantification.

284. Descriptions ("the so-and-so") are incomplete symbols requiring contextual definition.

285. Descriptions do not function as names; they are quantificational constructions.

286. "The present King of France is bald" is false, not meaningless, because the description is empty.

287. Existence is not a predicate; "exists" is properly expressed by the existential quantifier.

288. The ontological argument fails because existence cannot be included in a concept.

289. Concepts are not in the mind; they are objective entities that minds can grasp.

290. Grasping a concept is a relation between a mind and an abstract entity.

291. Abstract entities are not created by abstraction; they exist independently.

292. Abstraction is a psychological process; what it discovers is not psychological.

293. Sets are not created by collecting; they exist prior to any mental act.

294. Mathematical objects are eternal and unchanging; they are outside time.

295. Mathematical truths are necessary truths; they could not have been otherwise.

296. Possible worlds are logical possibilities; the actual world is one among many.

297. Logical space contains all possible configurations of objects and relations.

298. Impossibilities are excluded from logical space; they are not even thinkable consistently.

299. Consistency is the criterion of logical possibility.

300. The actual world differs from merely possible worlds by some non-logical feature (existence).

INTRODUCTION TO MATHEMATICAL PHILOSOPHY POSITION STATEMENT 

1. Mathematics and logic have the same scope, dealing with objects having certain properties and relations.

2. Pure mathematics consists entirely of assertions that if one thing has a certain property and implies another, then the latter has that property.

3. All pure mathematics is a priori and deducible from the general principles of logic.

4. The fact that mathematical propositions appear to deal with material objects is an accidental characteristic of historically contingent symbolism.

5. Mathematical knowledge is not obtained by induction from experience.

6. The solution to the contradictions that plagued traditional infinitesimal calculus lies in the logical theory of infinite number and continuity.

7. Philosophy must analyze the general nature of propositions, propositional functions, classes, and relations to clarify mathematics.

8. Modern mathematical philosophy begins with the realization that number is not a property of aggregates but applies to classes.

9. A philosophical account of number must avoid psychological elements and focus on logical definitions.

10. All traditional pure mathematics can be derived from the primitive ideas and propositions of Principia Mathematica.

11. Three different matters are lumped together under the name “number”: cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, and numbers as exponents (e.g., in “a²”).

12. Cardinal numbers are concerned with “how many” items are in a class.

13. Two classes have the same cardinal number if there is a one-to-one relation between their terms.

14. Cardinal numbers are themselves classes of similar classes.

15. The cardinal number of a class α is the class of all classes similar (equipotent) to α.

16. Zero is the class containing only the null-class.

17. Finite cardinal numbers are those belonging to every inductive class (starting from 0 and closed under the successor relation).

18. The successor of a cardinal number n is the number of the class obtained by adding one new member to a class with n members.

19. Addition of cardinal numbers is defined via disjoint classes and their union.

20. Multiplication of cardinal numbers is defined via the logical product (intersection) of classes and one-to-one correspondence.

21. Dedekind’s definition of infinite classes: a class is infinite if it is similar to a proper part of itself.

22. Reflexive classes (finite) are those not similar to any proper part of themselves.

23. The axiom of infinity is required to guarantee the existence of infinite classes in the actual world.

24. Ordinal similarity: two relations P and Q are ordinally similar if there is a one-to-one relation S correlating their fields such that if P holds between x and y, then Q holds between S(x) and S(y).

25. Ordinal numbers are relation-types under ordinal similarity.

26. The ordinal number of a well-ordered series is the class of all well-ordered series ordinally similar to it.

27. Every well-ordered series has a unique ordinal number.

28. Transfinite ordinal numbers exist beyond the finite ordinals.

29. ω is the ordinal number of the series of finite integers in their natural order.

30. Addition of ordinals is not commutative (e.g., 1 + ω = ω, but ω + 1 ≠ ω).

31. Multiplication of ordinals is also not commutative.

32. The series of ordinals is itself well-ordered and has no maximum.

33. The continuum hypothesis and the problem of finding the number of possible ordinals less than the continuum remain open.

34. A series has continuity if it is Dedekindian (every subclass with a first term has a successor) and compact (every subclass has both a first and last term or is endless in one direction).

35. The rational numbers in order of magnitude form a series that is Dedekindian but not compact.

36. The real numbers in order of magnitude form a perfect series (both Dedekindian and compact).

37. Zermelo’s theorem: every class can be well-ordered if the axiom of choice is assumed.

38. Description is a denoting phrase that denotes an object via a unique property, but the object itself is not a constituent of propositions containing the description.

39. A propositional function φx is any expression containing x that becomes a proposition when a definite value is assigned to x.

40. Propositional functions may be true for all values of x, some values, or no values.

41. The assertion “∃x . φx” means that φx is true for at least one value of x.

42. Formal implication “φx ⊃ ψx” means that for all x, if φx then ψx.

43. Classes are defined extensionally as the collection of all objects satisfying a given propositional function.

44. The null-class is the class of objects satisfying a contradictory propositional function.

45. The universal class is the class of objects satisfying a tautological propositional function.

46. Unit classes are classes containing exactly one member.

47. The relation of a member to its unit class is fundamental and indefinable.

48. Relations are extensional: two relations are identical if they hold between the same pairs.

49. The relative product R|S of two relations is the relation that holds when there is an intermediate term connected by both R and S.

50. The converse of a relation R is the relation that holds in the reverse order.

51. The domain of a relation is the class of terms that have the relation to something.

52. The converse domain is the class of terms to which something has the relation.

53. The field of a relation is the sum of domain and converse domain.

54. A relation is connex when for any two distinct terms in its field, one has the relation to the other or vice versa.

55. Series are relations that are transitive, asymmetrical, and connex in their field.

56. The principle of abstraction states that every many-one relation defines a class of equivalent terms.

57. The axiom of reducibility ensures the existence of predicative functions equivalent to any function.

58. Mathematical induction is valid for finite numbers because they are defined inductively.

59. Infinite collections require new axioms (e.g., axiom of infinity) beyond pure logic.

60. Geometry can be treated purely analytically without reference to space as a separate entity.

61. Points, lines, and planes are logical constructions from relations.

62. The apparent necessity of mathematical propositions is explained by their tautological character.

63. Kant’s synthetic a priori judgments in mathematics are rejected; all mathematical truths are analytic.

64. The philosophy of mathematics must distinguish between the psychological process of discovery and the logical structure of the finished science.

65. Definitions in mathematics are not arbitrary but must preserve the meaning of the defined term in its previous uses.

66. The vicious-circle paradoxes (e.g., Russell’s paradox) are resolved by the theory of types and the hierarchy of propositional functions.

67. Simple type theory arranges objects, functions of individuals, functions of functions, etc., into distinct types.

68. The ramified theory of types further distinguishes orders within each type to avoid impredicative definitions.

69. The no-classes theory eliminates classes as entities by treating statements about classes as statements about propositional functions.

70. Identity is not a relation between objects but a logical device for asserting that two names denote the same object.

71. The statement “Scott is the author of Waverley” expresses an identity, not a relation of predication.

72. Definite descriptions (“the so-and-so”) are incomplete symbols that disappear on logical analysis.

73. The theory of definite descriptions resolves puzzles like “the present King of France is bald.”

74. Scope distinctions in descriptions resolve ambiguities in negation and modality.

75. Mathematics is the science in which we never know what we are talking about nor whether what we say is true (in the sense of being about indefinable primitives).

76. The primitives of logic (e.g., negation, disjunction, universal quantification) suffice to define all mathematical concepts.

77. The reduction of mathematics to logic shows that mathematical certainty rests on logical certainty.

78. Empiricist attempts to derive mathematics from experience fail because mathematical propositions are necessary and universal.

79. The logistic thesis (Frege-Russell) that mathematics is an extension of logic is defended against Poincaré and other critics.

80. Infinity is not a single idea but a hierarchy: infinite cardinals, infinite ordinals, the continuum, etc.

81. The transfinite is as legitimate as the finite once the correct logical definitions are given.

82. The paradoxes of infinity (Galileo, Bolzano) are resolved by distinguishing cardinal and ordinal aspects.

83. Cantor’s theory of transfinite numbers is accepted and integrated into logic.

84. The power-class (set of all subsets) of an infinite set is larger than the set itself.

85. There is no greatest cardinal number.

86. The arithmetic of transfinite cardinals obeys different laws from finite arithmetic (e.g., ℵ₀ + 1 = ℵ₀).

87. The continuum has cardinality 2^ℵ₀, which may or may not equal ℵ₁.

88. Order-types provide a more refined classification than mere cardinality.

89. Well-ordering is not an intrinsic property of series but depends on the choice of ordering relation.

90. The multiplicative axiom (axiom of choice) is independent of other logical principles.

91. Mathematics without the axiom of choice is weaker but still consistent.

92. Physical applications of infinity (e.g., space, time) are philosophically problematic but mathematically legitimate.

93. The logical antinomies show the need for a rigorous theory of types.

94. Impredicative definitions are legitimate if confined within the same type and order via reducibility.

95. The future development of mathematical philosophy lies in further analysis of order, series, and continuity.

96. Mathematics is distinguished from empirical science by its independence from sensory observation.

97. The certainty of mathematics derives from its tautological nature once primitives are granted.

98. Philosophy benefits from mathematical logic by gaining precision and freedom from contradictions.

99. The ultimate primitives of logic remain indefinable, known by acquaintance.

100. The aim of mathematical philosophy is to exhibit mathematics as a consistent, purely deductive system built on the fewest possible primitive ideas and propositions.

HUMAN KNOWLEDGE ITS SCOPE AND LIMITS POSITION STATEMENT 

1. The aim of the book is to examine what can be genuinely known and the degrees of doubt or certainty attaching to different kinds of putative knowledge.

2. Knowledge is divided into two main kinds: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description.

3. Knowledge by acquaintance is direct awareness without inference (e.g., sense-data, memory-images, introspection of mental states, and possibly universals).

4. Knowledge by description always depends ultimately on knowledge by acquaintance.

5. Sense-data are the immediate objects of perception; physical objects are inferred from them.

6. Physical objects (tables, chairs, stars) are not known by acquaintance but are logical constructions out of sense-data and sensibilia.

7. The external world is known only as the class of actual and possible sense-data satisfying certain causal laws.

8. Solipsism is logically irrefutable but psychologically incredible.

9. The principle of induction cannot be proved by experience, yet it is presupposed by all empirical knowledge.

10. There are five postulates of scientific inference needed to justify induction and the belief in an external world.

11. The first postulate: the postulate of quasi-permanence (things change slowly).

12. The second postulate: separate causal lines (events have relatively independent causal histories).

13. The third postulate: spatio-temporal continuity in causal chains.

14. The fourth postulate: the structural postulate (similar causes have similar effects).

15. The fifth postulate: the postulate of causality (every event has a cause).

16. These postulates are not logically necessary but are justified pragmatically by the success of science.

17. Memory is not infallible; it provides only probable knowledge.

18. Introspective knowledge of current mental states is the most certain kind of knowledge.

19. Universals (relations such as “before,” “greater than,” “resembles”) are known by acquaintance.

20. All a priori knowledge deals with relations of universals.

21. Logical principles (e.g., law of contradiction) are known by intuition of universals.

22. The law of contradiction is not known to hold in the empirical world with certainty.

23. Probability, not certainty, is the guide in most empirical beliefs.

24. There are two kinds of probability: mathematical (degree of credibility) and empirical (relative frequency).

25. The principle of induction itself has only probabilistic justification.

26. Scientific laws are not known to be true but to be increasingly probable as evidence accumulates.

27. Causality is not a relation between events but a functional relation between kinds of events.

28. Determinism is neither provable nor refutable by science.

29. The concept of “cause” in advanced science is replaced by functional laws.

30. Space and time are not absolute (as Newton thought) nor purely subjective (as Kant thought).

31. Physical space is a construction from perspectival spaces derived from different observers.

32. Einstein’s theory of relativity provides the best current account of space-time.

33. Matter is a logical construction from events and their causal relations.

34. The distinction between mind and matter becomes less sharp when both are constructed from neutral events.

35. Consciousness is not a datum for science; physics can be complete without mentioning it.

36. The causal efficacy of mind (mental causation) remains philosophically problematic.

37. Self-consciousness gives knowledge of the self only as the subject of current experience.

38. The continuity of the self through time is an inference, not a datum.

39. Other minds are known only by analogy from behavior.
