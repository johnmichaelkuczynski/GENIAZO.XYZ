--- MAJOR VIEWS ---
1. VIEW: Philosophy of religion doesn't concern religion itself
   EVIDENCE: "The so-called philosophy of religion doesn't concern religion."

2. VIEW: Philosophy of religion concerns logical puzzles
   EVIDENCE: "It concerns puzzles that can be illustrated in connection with religious questions but are really of a strictly logical nature."

3. VIEW: The Omnipotence Paradox (OG) is not about God
   EVIDENCE: "OG doesn't have anything to do with God."

4. VIEW: The Omnipotence Paradox is about logical subtleties
   EVIDENCE: "It has to do with subtleties of logic that, although they can be illustrated in connection with statements concerning God, have nothing to do with Her."

5. VIEW: The Omnipotence Paradox parallels the Barber Paradox
   EVIDENCE: "OG perfectly parallels the following argument."

6. VIEW: Both the Omnipotence and Barber Paradoxes expose logical problems with quantifiers
   EVIDENCE: "Both paradoxes expose logical problems relating to the use of quantifiers."

7. VIEW: Philosophy of religion often veers off into irrelevant logical minutiae
   EVIDENCE: "its efforts to do this quickly veer off course and end up bogging down in logical minutiae that are of no relevance to religion at all."

8. VIEW: St. Thomas Aquinas's argument (AG1) is flawed
   EVIDENCE: "So Aquinas has simply assumed that there was a first event, and he thus hasn't established it at all."

9. VIEW: The first sentence of AG1 is ambiguous
   EVIDENCE: "The first sentence of AG1, which we'll refer to as (a), is ambiguous."

10. VIEW: AG1's first sentence can mean two different things
   EVIDENCE: "It could mean either: (a1) Given any event x, there is some event y, such that y precedes x or (a2) there is some event x such that, for any event y, x precedes y."

11. VIEW: AG1 fails if interpreted with meaning (a1)
   EVIDENCE: "So (a) fails if (a) is taken to have (a1) for its meaning, and AG1 must therefore be assumed to have (a2) for its meaning."

12. VIEW: Assuming a first event does not prove God's existence
   EVIDENCE: "But supposing, if only for argument's sake, that there was a first event, it doesn't follow, at least not for any obvious reason, that it was an act of God."

13. VIEW: Atheists might be inconsistent in believing in a first event
   EVIDENCE: "It may be that atheists cannot, without being guilty of inconsistency, believe in a first event (such as the Big Bang)."

14. VIEW: Aquinas's second argument (AG2) for God's existence is flawed
   EVIDENCE: "AG2 is a failure."

15. VIEW: Comparatives do not require absolutes
   EVIDENCE: "Contrary to what Aquinas believes, there don't have to be absolutes for there to be comparatives."

16. VIEW: The statement about Smith's condition being more like a perfect entity's is syntactically ambiguous
   EVIDENCE: "(#) is ambiguous not because it contains an ambiguous constituent, but because there are two different ways of parsing it."

17. VIEW: Syntactic ambiguity arises from different ways of parsing a sentence
   EVIDENCE: "An expression is syntactically ambiguous iff it can be parsed in more than one way."

18. VIEW: Pre-modern philosophers were only dimly aware of syntactic ambiguity
   EVIDENCE: "Pre-modern philosophers, such as Aquinas, were only dimly aware of"

19. VIEW: Syntactic ambiguity causes problems with AG2
   EVIDENCE: "the phenomenon of syntactic ambiguity. Hence the problems with AG2."

20. VIEW: Studying Aquinas's arguments teaches about sentence structure and argumentation
   EVIDENCE: "In the course of studying these two arguments, we've learned a lot about sentence structure and about argumentation in general."

21. VIEW: Studying Aquinas's arguments does not teach about God or religion
   EVIDENCE: "But we didn't learn anything about God or religion."

22. VIEW: Aquinas's arguments do not indicate whether God exists or not
   EVIDENCE: "But his arguments don't fail in a way that gives us any indication as to whether God does or does not exist."

23. VIEW: It is futile to provide rational arguments for or against religious belief
   EVIDENCE: "1.1 The futility of trying to provide rational arguments for or against religious belief"

24. VIEW: Religion is not science or logic
   EVIDENCE: "Religion is not science or logic, and to the extent that one's beliefs are based on rational consideration of the relevant evidence, one is a person of science, not of religion."

25. VIEW: Smith is not religious
   EVIDENCE: "Smith hasn't a religious bone in his body."

26. VIEW: Smith is an open thinker
   EVIDENCE: "But he's an open thinker and doesn't want to assume, without first exercising due diligence, either that God exists or that God does not exist."

27. VIEW: Smith does not conclude that God doesn't exist based on bogus evidence
   EVIDENCE: "Smith doesn't conclude that God doesn't exist."

28. VIEW: Smith concludes he doesn't yet have reason to believe otherwise based on bogus evidence
   EVIDENCE: "Being a scientifically minded person, he rightly concludes only that he doesn't yet have reason to believe otherwise."

29. VIEW: Smith warms to the idea that God exists based on convincing evidence
   EVIDENCE: "Since he finds it convincing, he begins to warm to the idea that God exists."

30. VIEW: Smith modifies his views based on new evidence
   EVIDENCE: "And if new evidence turns up, he'll modify his views accordingly."

31. VIEW: Smith's belief in God is contingent on available evidence
   EVIDENCE: "Smith's belief in God goes only as far as the available evidence permits."

32. VIEW: Smith is not religious even if he believes in God
   EVIDENCE: "For this reason, even if Smith does finally arrive at the belief that God exists, he isn't religious."

33. VIEW: A person can be both religious and scientific
   EVIDENCE: "Of course, one can be both religious and scientific."

34. VIEW: Newton was very religious
   EVIDENCE: "Newton was very religious."

35. VIEW: Newton would not have been religious if his beliefs about God were as evidence-based as his beliefs about physics
   EVIDENCE: "Had Newton's beliefs about God been as evidence-based as his beliefs about physics, he would not have been a religious person."

36. VIEW: A person who believes in God isn't religious if their belief is contingent on data consistency
   EVIDENCE: "A person who believes in God isn't religious if that person's acceptance of that position is contingent on its being consistent with the data."

37. VIEW: It is silly to try to undermine religious belief by arguing it doesn't square with the facts
   EVIDENCE: "This is why it's silly to try to undermine religious belief by arguing that it doesn't square with the facts."

38. VIEW: Religious belief is not subject to views on what inferences the available data warrants
   EVIDENCE: "What distinguishes religious from scientific belief is precisely that the former, unlike the latter, isn't subject to one's views as to what inferences the available data warrants."

39. VIEW: Religious people are unmoved by anti-religious arguments
   EVIDENCE: "Religious people know this. That's why they are unmoved by anti-religious arguments."

40. VIEW: Religious people are right to be unmoved by anti-religious arguments
   EVIDENCE: "And they're right to be unmoved."

41. VIEW: A religious attitude is not marked by subservience to data and logic
   EVIDENCE: "To the extent that it's a religious attitude they wish to hold onto, it would be incoherent of them to regard recalcitrant data as giving them a reason to jettison that attitude, since a religious attitude is precisely one that isn't marked by the subservience to data and logic characteristic of the scientific view."

42. VIEW: The author is not a religious person
   EVIDENCE: "I am not a religious person and I don't believe in God."

43. VIEW: The author's views on religion are biased in favor of an anti-religious perspective
   EVIDENCE: "what I say about religion is biased in favor of an anti-religious perspective."

44. VIEW: The chapter won't target religious belief
   EVIDENCE: "this chapter won't target religious belief."

45. VIEW: The arguments in the chapter have anti-religious consequences
   EVIDENCE: "I will put forth some arguments that might appear to have anti-religious consequences."

46. VIEW: The arguments in the chapter do not really have anything to do with religion
   EVIDENCE: "But, though I obviously accept those arguments, what they prove, in my opinion, doesn't really have anything to do with religion."

47. VIEW: The arguments in the chapter have to do with attempts to doctrinalize religious sentiment
   EVIDENCE: "It has to do with certain attempts to doctrinalize religious sentiment-that is, with attempts to identify religious sentiment with acceptance of well defined contentions as to how the world is."

48. VIEW: Religion typically involves acceptance of well-defined contentions
   EVIDENCE: "religion typically involves acceptance of well-defined contentions (concerning morality, the structure of the universe, etc.)"

49. VIEW: Attacking religion on scientific or logical grounds is misguided
   EVIDENCE: "those who attack religion on scientific or logical grounds-on the grounds that what Darwin or Einstein said is inconsistent with this or that religious contention- are misguidedly trying to understand religious sentiment in epistemological terms"

50. VIEW: Religious sentiment should be understood in psychoanalytic terms
   EVIDENCE: "when in fact it is to be understood in psychoanalytic terms"

51. VIEW: The philosophy of religion tends to be sterile
   EVIDENCE: "And this, I believe, is part of the reason why the philosophy of religion tends to be so sterile."

52. VIEW: Attempts to liberalize religious belief are futile
   EVIDENCE: "1.3 The futility of attempts to liberalize religious belief"

53. VIEW: Saying 'God is love' is not the view of somebody who believes in God
   EVIDENCE: "But it isn't the view of somebody who believes in God."

54. VIEW: Freud was an atheist who believed that people sometimes love other people
   EVIDENCE: "Freud was an atheist, and he certainly believed that people sometimes love other people."

55. VIEW: Identifying God with logic, truth, or reason is not the view of a religious person
   EVIDENCE: "But they're not the views of a religious person, since there is no shortage of dedicated atheists who believe in logic"

56. VIEW: The author does not know whether there is a God
   EVIDENCE: "I don't know whether there is a God."

57. VIEW: The author does not know what it means to say that there is a God
   EVIDENCE: "I don't even know what it means to say that there is a God."

58. VIEW: God isn't truth, logic, or love
   EVIDENCE: "So God isn't truth, logic, or love"

59. VIEW: Attempts to identify God with reason or truth or love are dishonest and incoherent
   EVIDENCE: "Attempts to identify God with reason or truth or love are dishonest and incoherent"

60. VIEW: Religious belief is free of the tentativeness and evidence-dependence of scientific belief
   EVIDENCE: "Given that religious belief is of its very nature free of the tentativeness and evidence-dependence of scientific belief"

61. VIEW: Religious people have no obligation to defend their views
   EVIDENCE: "religious people have no obligation to defend their views."

62. VIEW: Some very great philosophers and scientists have been devoutly religious
   EVIDENCE: "some very great philosophers and scientists (e.g., Kant, Newton) have been devoutly religious"

63. VIEW: A view that is only as good as the logic and evidence underlying it is a non-religious view
   EVIDENCE: "a view that is only as good as the logic and evidence underlying it is ipso facto a non-religious view."

64. VIEW: Defending a view concedes that it needs a defense and is presumed false until proven correct
   EVIDENCE: "In defending a view that one holds, one is conceding that it needs a defense and therefore that it is to be presumed false until proven correct."

65. VIEW: Defending a religious view is almost the same as apologizing for it
   EVIDENCE: "Defending a religious view is the same as explaining why one holds it, and explaining why one holds it is almost the same as apologizing for it."

66. VIEW: Many self-described atheists are actually crypto-believers
   EVIDENCE: "many self-described atheists are actually crypto-believers."

67. VIEW: Some philosophers speaking of logical or ethical standards may be speaking about God
   EVIDENCE: "when some philosophers speak of the logical or ethical standards to which judgments and acts ought to conform, they are at some level speaking about God."

68. VIEW: Acceptance of logical or ethical standards can be an expression of belief in God
   EVIDENCE: "Acceptance of such rarefied and depersonalized arbiters and right and wrong is sometimes, I would conjecture, a distorted and oblique expression of a belief in God."

69. VIEW: There is no relationship between the degree of religiosity and intelligence
   EVIDENCE: "Is there a relationship between the degree to which one is religious and the extent to which one is intelligent? No."

70. VIEW: Some of the most intelligent people are religious
   EVIDENCE: "Some of the most intelligent people I know, or know of, are religious"

71. VIEW: Some of the least intelligent people are non-religious
   EVIDENCE: "some of the least intelligent are non-religious."

72. VIEW: Religious belief isn't about facts or logic
   EVIDENCE: "The reason why people of such intelligence may believe in religious doctrines that are insufficiently supported by facts and logic is that religious belief isn't about facts or logic."

73. VIEW: Philosophy has nothing to teach us about religion, with one exception
   EVIDENCE: "There is only one qualification to my previous statement that philosophy has nothing to teach us about religion."

74. VIEW: Plato's Euthyphro argument is cogent
   EVIDENCE: "I consider that argument to be cogent."

75. VIEW: Understanding the Euthyphro Argument is a reliable indicator of philosophical aptitude
   EVIDENCE: "Anthony Flew, a contemporary philosopher, said that there is an easy and reliable way to determine whether a person has an aptitude for philosophy: she does if she understands the Euthyphro Argument; she doesn't if she doesn't."

76. VIEW: Agreement with the Euthyphro argument's conclusion indicates non-religiosity
   EVIDENCE: "If she agrees with the conclusion of the Euthyphro argument, she's not religious; and if she disagrees with it, she is."

77. VIEW: Some acts are inherently good and others are inherently bad
   EVIDENCE: "Some acts are good and others are bad."

78. VIEW: The goodness of an act is not determined by God's liking it
   EVIDENCE: "If an act is good, that is because God likes it. In other words, God's liking it is what causes it to be good. If an act is bad, God's disliking it is what causes it to be bad. Until God likes or dislikes an act, it remains neutral. Basically, to be good is to be liked by God, and to be bad is to be disliked by God. Of course, G assumes that God exists. For argument's sake, let's grant that assumption. Is G correct? No."

79. VIEW: Rape would remain bad even if God liked it
   EVIDENCE: "What if God liked rape? Would that make it good? No. Rape would be bad even if God liked it, and God would be bad for liking it."

80. VIEW: Acts of kindness would remain good even if God disliked them
   EVIDENCE: "What if God disliked acts of kindness? Would that make such acts bad? No. They would still be good, and God would be bad for disliking them."

81. VIEW: God's maximal goodness does not validate the claim that God's preferences determine morality
   EVIDENCE: "CG doesn't work."

82. VIEW: God has a reason for disliking rape, based on its inherent wrongness
   EVIDENCE: "Surely God has a good reason for disliking rape. But what could that reason be? The answer is clear: rape is bad; rape is wrong."

83. VIEW: Morality is independent of God's views
   EVIDENCE: "Conclusion: Morality is independent of God's views."

84. VIEW: God's moral perfection and intellectual infallibility align with inherent moral truths
   EVIDENCE: "If, as many of us believe, God is morally perfect and intellectually infallible, then God will like all morally good acts and dislike all morally bad ones."

85. VIEW: God cannot make rape morally good
   EVIDENCE: "Could God make rape to be morally good? No. Even God cannot make rape be good."

86. VIEW: Claims of divine commands to commit evil acts are inconsistent with our moral views
   EVIDENCE: "One reason is that what the ghoul in question is claiming is inconsistent with our views about morality."

87. VIEW: Claims of divine commands to commit evil acts are often doubted due to other factors like mental illness or political ambition
   EVIDENCE: "There is independent evidence of mental illness or of political ambition or of some other factor that would explain why, even though God did not speak to him, the evil-doer in question would say otherwise."

88. VIEW: Even if God speaks to individuals, it is not because of His commands that we believe certain acts are wrong
   EVIDENCE: "This shows that even if God speaks to certain individuals, it isn't because of what He told them that we believe that rape, theft, and so on, are wrong."

89. VIEW: God would never condemn certain actions
   EVIDENCE: "think that God would never condemn it"

90. VIEW: The author's arguments will not affect those who already believe certain actions are wrong
   EVIDENCE: "I'll have no effect on those who already think that x is wrong"

91. VIEW: The legitimacy of a claim that God said something can only be determined by considering the merits of the claim itself
   EVIDENCE: "it is only by considering the merits of X itself that we can determine whether that claim is legitimate or not"

92. VIEW: Our acceptance or rejection of a claim is not based on what God says
   EVIDENCE: "our decision to accept or reject X is not based on what God says"

93. VIEW: Our views on right and wrong are independent of what God believes
   EVIDENCE: "Our views as to what is right and wrong don't have anything to do with what God believes"

94. VIEW: The Divine Command Theory cannot legitimate existing religious practices or beliefs
   EVIDENCE: "the Divine Command Theory can do nothing in the way of legitimating existing religious practices or beliefs"

95. VIEW: Many people believe in the existence of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing God
   EVIDENCE: "Many people hold that there is a God and that He is all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing"

96. VIEW: The existence of bad things in the world suggests that either God does not exist or is not all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing
   EVIDENCE: "This suggests that there is no God or that, if there is a God, He isn't all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing"

97. VIEW: Some people believe there is no God
   EVIDENCE: "There is no God"

98. VIEW: Some people believe there is a God but He is not all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing
   EVIDENCE: "There is a God, but He's not all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing"

99. VIEW: Some people believe there is no real badness, only the illusion of it
   EVIDENCE: "There is no badness-there is only the illusion of badness"

100. VIEW: Some people believe that if we knew God's master plan, we would understand why bad things happen
   EVIDENCE: "If we were to know God's master- plan, we'd see that it's okay that people have their arms and legs blown off"

101. VIEW: It is possible to believe in both the existence of badness and an all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing God
   EVIDENCE: "there is nothing absurd in believing in the existence of badness and in the existence of all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing God"

102. VIEW: The view that God exists and is all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing despite the existence of evil is considered philosophically interesting
   EVIDENCE: "there is a fourth view, and it is the view that, from a philosophical standpoint, is the most interesting"

103. VIEW: Some thinkers believe that the existence of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing God is coherent despite the existence of evil
   EVIDENCE: "many fine thinkers hold that (d) is not incoherent"

104. VIEW: Theodicies are attempts to show that the existence of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing God is coherent despite evil
   EVIDENCE: "Attempts to show that (d) is coherent are known as theodicies"

105. VIEW: God wants the world to be as good as possible
   EVIDENCE: "Because He is good, God wants the world to be a good place. In fact, He wants it to be as good as possible"

106. VIEW: A world with free will is better than a world without it
   EVIDENCE: "A world where nothing has free will wouldn't be a very good world, and it wouldn't be as good as one where there were creatures with free will"

107. VIEW: A world of robots who do no wrong is not as good as a world of free creatures that do some wrong
   EVIDENCE: "A world of robots who do no wrong isn't as good as a world of free creatures that do some wrong"

108. VIEW: God gave humans free will to avoid them being soulless robots
   EVIDENCE: "Not wanting us to be soulless robots, God gave us free will"

109. VIEW: God stepping in to prevent every disaster would make life too easy
   EVIDENCE: "In that case, life would be a big cakewalk, and we, as a species, would never develop any character."

110. VIEW: Preventing all disasters would prevent human development of character
   EVIDENCE: "we, as a species, would never develop any character."

111. VIEW: Human ingenuity and fortitude would not be tested if God prevented all disasters
   EVIDENCE: "Our ingenuity and fortitude would never be put to the test."

112. VIEW: Preventing all disasters would deprive humans of a chance to prove and improve themselves
   EVIDENCE: "We'd be deprived of a chance to prove and improve ourselves, which would strip life of much of its meaning."

113. VIEW: Life without challenges would be meaningless
   EVIDENCE: "if it weren't a challenge, it wouldn't be meaningful."

114. VIEW: A certain amount of strife enriches life
   EVIDENCE: "A certain amount of strife enriches life."

115. VIEW: Too much strife impoverishes life
   EVIDENCE: "But too much impoverishes it."

116. VIEW: There is too much strife for the theodicy to work
   EVIDENCE: "There's too much strife for this theodicy to work."

117. VIEW: God cannot make 1 + 1 = 3
   EVIDENCE: "She is unable to make 1 + 1 = 3."

118. VIEW: Something is impossible if the idea of doing it is incoherent
   EVIDENCE: "For something to be impossible is not for it to be very hard to do: it is for the very idea of doing that thing to be an incoherent one."

119. VIEW: Reading a thousand-page book in two seconds is logically possible but practically impossible
   EVIDENCE: "The reason it is possible to read such a large book in so little time is that the idea of doing so is not incoherent."

120. VIEW: Something preexisting itself is logically impossible
   EVIDENCE: "It seems impossible, in other words, that something should come into existence before it comes into existence."

121. VIEW: Impossibilities are expressed by self-undermining statements
   EVIDENCE: "Impossibilities are expressed by self-undermining statements and, therefore, by non-statements."

122. VIEW: The statement 'X preexists itself' is self-defeating
   EVIDENCE: "The statement: (PE) X preexists itself denies the very thing that it affirms."

123. VIEW: God cannot create a square circle
   EVIDENCE: "I say 'no.'"

124. VIEW: God's inability to create a square circle does not limit Her powers
   EVIDENCE: "this does not show that Her powers are in any way limited."

125. VIEW: A square circle is an impossibility because it involves contradictory definitions
   EVIDENCE: "A square is by definition something that has four straight sides. A circle is by definition something that has no straight sides."

126. VIEW: Saying God cannot create a square circle does not ascribe any limitation to God's powers
   EVIDENCE: "So in saying that God cannot create a square circle, there is no coherent statement that we are negating, and we are therefore not managing to ascribe any genuine limitation to God's powers."

127. VIEW: Impossibility is often mistakenly thought of as a property of things
   EVIDENCE: "We pre-theoretically tend to think of impossibility as a property of things."

128. VIEW: The statement about square circles and other impossibilities is not incoherent
   EVIDENCE: "But it is not incoherent."

129. VIEW: SC makes a statement about statements, not objects
   EVIDENCE: "SC doesn't make a statement about objects: it makes a statement about statements."

130. VIEW: All statements of the form 'X is a square circle' are false
   EVIDENCE: "It says that all statements of the form X is a square circle (and X is a perpetual motion machine and X is an even prime greater than two) are false."

131. VIEW: SC does not say that any object is or is not a perpetual motion machine
   EVIDENCE: "So SC doesn't say of any object that it is, or is not, a perpetual motion machine."

132. VIEW: There are no perpetual motion machines
   EVIDENCE: "It couldn't possibly say this, since there are no perpetual motions and there are therefore no perpetual motion machines of which to say that they are impossible."

133. VIEW: SC makes a statement about existing statements
   EVIDENCE: "Rather than making a statement about non-existent perpetual motion machines...SC makes a statement about very much existing statements."

134. VIEW: Every statement of the form 'X is a perpetual motion machine' is untrue
   EVIDENCE: "More specifically, it says that every statement having the form X is a perpetual motion machine is untrue."

135. VIEW: Impossibility is not a property of things
   EVIDENCE: "In general, impossibility is not a property of things."

136. VIEW: If something is impossible, it does not exist
   EVIDENCE: "After all, if something is impossible, then it cannot, and therefore does not, exist."

137. VIEW: Impossibility is a property of statements
   EVIDENCE: "Impossibility is a property, not of things, but of statements."

138. VIEW: A statement is impossible if it is incoherent
   EVIDENCE: "And, as we saw in the previous section, a statement is impossible if it is incoherent."

139. VIEW: Most incoherent statements contradict themselves implicitly
   EVIDENCE: "We must bear in mind that most incoherent statements contradict themselves implicitly, not explicitly."

140. VIEW: The statement 'X is knowledge, but it isn't true belief' is incoherent
   EVIDENCE: "The statement: (KB) X is knowledge, but it isn't true belief is incoherent."

141. VIEW: The statement 'X is knowledge, but it isn't true belief' implicitly has the form P and not-P
   EVIDENCE: "Since any instance of knowledge is necessarily an instance of true belief, KB does, albeit implicitly, say that X simultaneously is, and is not, true belief."

142. VIEW: Saying that God cannot do the impossible does not imply the existence of impossible objects
   EVIDENCE: "To say that God cannot do the impossible is therefore not to say that there exist certain things that God cannot do or objects that He cannot create."

143. VIEW: There are no impossible objects
   EVIDENCE: "There exist no impossible objects."

144. VIEW: If something exists, it is not impossible
   EVIDENCE: "If something exists, then it isn't impossible."

145. VIEW: There are incoherent statements
   EVIDENCE: "But there are incoherent statements."

146. VIEW: An incoherent statement ultimately does not say anything
   EVIDENCE: "An incoherent statement is one that does not, ultimately, say anything (since it denies, and therefore retracts, what it affirms)."

147. VIEW: An incoherent statement, at some level, is meaningful
   EVIDENCE: "The statement: (A) X is a square circle is obviously, at some level, meaningful; and it obviously does say something."

148. VIEW: The utterance 'Frog the marathon pool clearly dabble' is completely meaningless
   EVIDENCE: "An example of a completely meaningless utterance-one that simply fails to say anything at all-would be: (B) Frog the marathon pool clearly dabble."

149. VIEW: The statement 'X is a square circle' is incoherent but not meaningless
   EVIDENCE: "It is clear that (A) is incoherent. But it is not clear that (A) is meaningless."

150. VIEW: The statement 'X is a square circle' seems to say something, albeit something defective
   EVIDENCE: "(A) very much does seem to say something, albeit something defective."

151. VIEW: For a statement to be meaningless is for it to have no meaning
   EVIDENCE: "For a statement to be meaningless is for it to have no meaning."

152. VIEW: For a statement to be incoherent is for it to have two or more opposed meanings
   EVIDENCE: "For a statement to be incoherent is for it to have two (or more) opposed meanings."

153. VIEW: The statement 'X is a square circle' has two meanings
   EVIDENCE: "By contrast, (A) has two meanings."

154. VIEW: The two meanings of 'X is a square circle' cancel each other out
   EVIDENCE: "But ultimately it has no meaning, since those two meanings cancel each other out."

155. VIEW: Incoherent statements ultimately fail to say anything
   EVIDENCE: "Therefore, my previous statement-that incoherent statements ultimately fail to say anything- has turned out to be true."
