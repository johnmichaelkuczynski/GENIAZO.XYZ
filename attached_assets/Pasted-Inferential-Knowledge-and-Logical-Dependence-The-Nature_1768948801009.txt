Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence

## The Nature of Knowledge and Inference

Some knowledge is direct; some is indirect. Indirect knowledge is knowledge that is acquired through inference from other beliefs, representing one of the most fundamental ways human beings extend their understanding beyond immediate experience. Consider how Newton arrived at his law of universal gravitation: he did not directly observe gravitational forces acting between celestial bodies, but rather inferred their existence from the observed motions of planets and moons. His knowledge of these forces was thus indirect, mediated by complex chains of reasoning from astronomical observations, mathematical calculations, and theoretical considerations.

To make an inference is to form a new belief on the basis of an old one. This seemingly simple process underlies virtually all human learning and scientific discovery. When Darwin observed the geographical distribution of finches in the Galápagos Islands and inferred their common descent from mainland ancestors, he was engaging in this fundamental cognitive operation. The formation of new beliefs through inference is not merely a mechanical process but involves the recognition of patterns, the application of logical principles, and often creative leaps that connect disparate observations into coherent theoretical frameworks.

Inferences, when legitimate, are made in accordance with legitimate rules of inference. These rules serve as the logical bridge between what we already know and what we can legitimately conclude. The rules of syllogistic reasoning discovered by Aristotle, for instance, specify precisely when we can move from premises like "All humans are mortal" and "Socrates is human" to the conclusion "Socrates is mortal." Similarly, the rules of mathematical proof allow us to derive new theorems from established axioms and previously proven results. Without such rules, inference would be merely arbitrary, and the growth of knowledge would be impossible.

Rules of inference, when legitimate, correspond to dependence-relations that exist objectively in the world. This correspondence is not accidental but reflects the fundamental structure of reality itself. When we employ modus ponens to move from "If it rains, the ground gets wet" and "It is raining" to "The ground gets wet," we are tracking a logical dependence relation that exists independently of our recognition of it. The legitimacy of our inferential rules derives precisely from their ability to capture these objective patterns of dependence.

There are two kinds of dependence-relations: logical and causal. This distinction is crucial for understanding the different ways in which knowledge can be organized and extended. Logical dependence operates in the realm of conceptual and mathematical truth, while causal dependence governs the physical interactions that shape our material environment. Both types of dependence provide the structural foundation for legitimate inference, though they operate according to different principles and serve different epistemic functions.

## Logical Dependence and Propositional Truth

Logical dependence-relations hold among propositions. A proposition is a truth or a falsehood—the kind of entity that can be evaluated for its truth value and can serve as the object of belief, doubt, or knowledge. Propositions differ fundamentally from sentences (which are linguistic entities), thoughts (which are mental entities), or states of affairs (which are worldly entities). The proposition that water boils at 100°C under standard pressure expresses the same content whether stated in English, German, or Chinese, and whether thought by Newton or Einstein.

The proposition that x is a triangle cannot be true unless the proposition that x has three sides is true. This exemplifies logical dependence in its purest form—a relationship that holds necessarily and can be known through conceptual analysis alone. The dependence here is not contingent upon any particular facts about the world but flows from the very meanings of the concepts involved. Other examples include the dependence of "x is a bachelor" upon "x is unmarried and male," or the dependence of "x is scarlet" upon "x is red." These relationships form the backbone of definitional knowledge and conceptual understanding.

Consider the logical dependence between mathematical propositions: the proposition that a number is divisible by 8 cannot be true unless the proposition that it is divisible by 4 is true. This dependence is discovered not through empirical investigation but through analysis of the logical structure implicit in our mathematical concepts. Such dependencies allow us to construct elaborate deductive systems, from Euclidean geometry to modern abstract algebra, where complex theorems follow necessarily from simpler axioms and definitions.

Causal relations hold among states of affairs, not truths and falsehoods. While logical dependence operates in the conceptual realm, causal dependence governs the temporal unfolding of events in the physical world. When lightning strikes a tree, causing it to split, we have a causal relationship between two states of affairs: the lightning strike and the tree's splitting. These are not propositions that can be true or false, but concrete occurrences located in space and time. The causal relationship involves energy transfer, structural changes, and temporal succession—none of which characterize logical relationships between propositions.

The objects of knowledge are propositions. It isn't known unless it's believed and it isn't believed unless it's a proposition. This claim has profound implications for understanding the nature of knowledge itself. We cannot know objects like rocks, trees, or people in the way we know propositions. Instead, we know propositions about these objects—that the rock is granite, that the tree is an oak, that the person is tall. Knowledge requires conceptual articulation and propositional form because only propositions can be evaluated for truth and can serve as the contents of beliefs.

One can be aware of non-propositions, e.g. rocks, trees, people, but one does not in the relevant sense know them. This distinction between propositional knowledge (knowing-that) and objectual awareness (knowing-of) is fundamental to epistemology. When I see a red rose in the garden, I am directly aware of the rose itself, but my knowledge that the rose is red requires the formation of a proposition that can be true or false. The rose itself cannot be true or false—only statements about the rose can have truth values.

## Conceptual Analysis and Analytic Knowledge

Some dependence-relations are known, not through sensory observation, but through conceptual analysis. The relationship between being a triangle and having three sides is discovered not by examining triangular objects in the world but by analyzing the concept of triangularity itself. Similarly, we know that nothing can be both entirely red and entirely green at the same time not through empirical investigation but through understanding what these color concepts mean and how they relate to each other.

Analytic knowledge is always knowledge of dependence-relations. When we engage in conceptual analysis, we are uncovering the logical dependencies that exist among our concepts. The mathematician who proves that all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd is discovering a logical dependence relationship between the concepts of primality and oddness. The philosopher who demonstrates that free actions must be done for reasons is revealing a conceptual connection between freedom and rationality. In each case, the knowledge gained consists in recognizing how certain truths depend upon others in virtue of their conceptual content.

This type of knowledge plays a crucial role in organizing and systematizing human understanding. By mapping out the logical dependencies among our concepts, we create frameworks for interpreting experience and guiding inquiry. The periodic table in chemistry, for instance, represents a complex web of dependencies among chemical concepts, allowing us to understand why elements with similar electron configurations exhibit similar properties.

## The Conceptual Articulation of Experience

Knowledge is conceptually articulated awareness. In order for me to know that my shoes are uncomfortably tight, I need to have the concepts shoe, tight, discomfort, etc. Without these concepts, I might experience the physical sensation but could not transform that experience into knowledge. The conceptual apparatus we bring to experience shapes what we can know about it. A person without the concept of irony cannot know that a situation is ironic, even if they observe all the relevant details. Similarly, someone lacking musical concepts cannot know that a piece is written in a minor key, even if they hear all the same sounds as a trained musician.

The requirement for conceptual articulation explains why knowledge is often difficult to acquire and why different individuals can observe the same phenomena yet come away with different knowledge. The biologist and the layperson looking at the same organism will acquire different knowledge because they bring different conceptual frameworks to the observation. The biologist's concepts of species, genus, adaptation, and evolution enable a kind of knowledge that is simply unavailable to someone lacking these theoretical resources.

I do not need to have these concepts—or, arguably, any concepts—to be aware of the uncomfortable tightness in my shoes. This highlights the distinction between mere awareness and knowledge proper. Awareness can be purely qualitative and non-conceptual, involving direct acquaintance with sensory qualities, emotional states, or other experiential contents. A dog can presumably be aware of uncomfortable sensations without possessing concepts like "shoe" or "tightness." But such awareness, however vivid or compelling, does not constitute knowledge in the strict sense.

There are two kinds of awareness: propositional and objectual. Propositional awareness involves grasping the content of propositions—understanding what they claim and recognizing their truth or falsehood. When I am aware that it is raining outside, my awareness has propositional content that can be evaluated for truth. Objectual awareness, by contrast, involves direct acquaintance with objects, qualities, or states of affairs. When I am aware of the red color of a rose or the pain in my foot, my awareness is objectual rather than propositional.

Observations are objectual awarenesses. The contents of such awarenesses must be converted into propositions if they are to be explained. When a scientist observes the behavior of particles in a cloud chamber, she has objectual awareness of the visible tracks and interactions. But to explain these observations—to integrate them into scientific theory and use them as evidence for claims about atomic structure—she must translate her objectual awareness into propositional form: "The track curves in this direction," "The collision produces two new tracks," "The particle's path is deflected by the magnetic field."

This translation process is neither automatic nor trivial. It requires theoretical background, conceptual sophistication, and often considerable interpretation. The same observable phenomena can be converted into quite different propositions depending on the theoretical framework employed. Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomers observed the same planetary motions but translated their observations into fundamentally different propositional claims about the structure of the cosmos.

## Causal Knowledge and Temporal Experience

Causal relations can be known only through one's senses (through sight, touch, etc.) and through real-time awareness of one's own psychological processes. Unlike logical dependencies, which can be discovered through pure conceptual analysis, causal relationships must be encountered through experience. We learn that fire causes burns not through analyzing the concepts of fire and burning, but through sensory observation of what happens when combustible materials contact flames. Similarly, we discover that loud noises cause startle responses through direct experience of these sequences.

The restriction of causal knowledge to sensory experience and psychological awareness has important implications. We cannot know causal relationships purely through reasoning, though we can certainly reason about them once they have been empirically discovered. The seventeenth-century mechanical philosophers like Descartes thought they could deduce the laws of physics from purely rational principles, but this approach failed precisely because causal relationships are contingent features of the world that must be discovered through observation.

Real-time awareness of psychological processes provides a special case of causal knowledge. When I experience anger arising from an insult, I have direct awareness of a causal sequence in my own mental life. This kind of first-person causal knowledge differs from third-person observation in important ways—I don't infer that the insult caused my anger, but rather experience the causal connection directly. However, such introspective causal knowledge is limited to concurrent psychological processes and cannot extend to the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.

## Theoretical Knowledge and Inferential Reasoning

Theoretical truths are necessarily known through inference, and knowledge of such truths is therefore inferential. Theoretical entities like quarks, black holes, or unconscious mental processes cannot be directly observed but must be postulated to explain observable phenomena. Our knowledge of such entities is always mediated by complex chains of inference from observational data to theoretical conclusions. Einstein's knowledge of the curvature of space-time, for instance, was inferential—derived from mathematical analysis of the implications of his field equations combined with observational confirmation through eclipse measurements.

But not all inferential knowledge is theoretical knowledge. I notice that you look tired and on that basis know that you didn't get enough sleep. This everyday inference differs from theoretical reasoning in several important ways. It doesn't postulate unobservable entities or processes, doesn't rely on precise mathematical relationships, and doesn't attempt to systematize large domains of phenomena. Yet it is genuinely inferential, involving a move from observed signs (tired appearance) to unobserved causes (insufficient sleep).

Such ordinary inferences are often more reliable than theoretical ones precisely because they operate within familiar domains where we have extensive background knowledge. The person who infers that their friend is upset from subtle changes in behavior may be more confident in this conclusion than a physicist calculating the mass of a distant star. The difference lies not in the logical structure of the inference but in the richness of our experience within different domains.

A theory is given by a proposition that, if true, describes some relatively comprehensive fact about the structure of the universe. Theories differ from mere generalizations or isolated claims in their scope and systematicity. Newton's theory of gravitation doesn't just claim that objects fall when dropped, but provides a unified explanation of terrestrial motion, planetary orbits, tidal forces, and cometary paths. Darwin's theory of evolution doesn't merely assert that species change over time, but explains the mechanisms of this change and connects it to biogeography, embryology, comparative anatomy, and the fossil record.

The comprehensiveness of theories makes them particularly powerful tools for organizing knowledge, but it also makes them more vulnerable to refutation. A theory that explains many phenomena can potentially be undermined by problems in any of its domains of application. This explains why theoretical knowledge tends to be more tentative than knowledge of particular facts—theories stake out larger claims and thus create more opportunities for error.

## The Structure of Knowledge

If you know it, then (i) You believe it, (ii) It is true, and (iii) Your reasons for believing it are legitimate. This analysis of knowledge as justified true belief captures essential features of the concept while revealing its complexity. Knowledge requires not just truth but also belief—you cannot know something you don't believe, even if it happens to be true. Moreover, knowledge requires legitimacy in the reasons for belief—lucky guesses or beliefs based on unreliable methods don't constitute knowledge even when they happen to be true.

The requirement for legitimate reasons connects knowledge to the broader framework of dependence-relations and inference rules. Your reasons are legitimate when they track real dependencies—either logical dependencies among propositions or causal dependencies among states of affairs. When these dependencies are properly recognized and followed, belief tends to converge on truth. When they are ignored or misunderstood, belief becomes unreliable and knowledge impossible.

At the same time, given only that it's true and that you are justified in believing it, it doesn't follow that you know it. This point was emphasized by Edmund Gettier's famous examples, which showed that justified true belief might not be sufficient for knowledge. Consider someone who believes it is 2:00 PM based on a reliable clock that has just stopped, and it happens to be exactly 2:00 PM. Their belief is true and seemingly justified, but intuitively they don't really know what time it is. Such cases suggest that knowledge requires an appropriate connection between the justification and the truth—the justification must succeed in virtue of its reliability, not merely by accident.

## Necessity and Evidence

Causal necessity is different from logical necessity. Given that x is a triangle, it is logically necessary that x have three sides. This necessity flows from the conceptual relationships among geometric concepts and cannot be avoided without changing the meanings of the terms involved. No possible world contains triangular objects that lack three sides, because such objects would not be triangular in the first place.

Causal necessity, by contrast, involves relationships that hold in virtue of the laws of nature rather than conceptual connections. Given that water is heated to 100°C at standard pressure, it is causally necessary that it boil—not because of the meanings of the concepts involved, but because of the molecular structure of water and the laws governing phase transitions. Unlike logical necessity, causal necessity is contingent—in a world with different laws of nature, water might behave differently.

This distinction has important implications for how we understand scientific knowledge. The laws of physics describe causal necessities that hold in our world but might not hold in other possible worlds. Logical necessities, by contrast, hold across all possible worlds because they reflect the structure of concepts rather than contingent features of reality. Mathematical truths like "2 + 2 = 4" would remain true even in a world with completely different laws of physics.

One state of affairs e is evidence of another state of affairs e* iff (if and only if) e and e* are causally related in such a way that, if one knows of e's existence, one has reason to believe in e*'s existence. This analysis connects the concept of evidence to causal dependence-relations in the world. Smoke is evidence of fire because smoke and fire are causally connected—fires produce smoke through combustion processes. The causal relationship provides the objective basis for the evidential relationship.
