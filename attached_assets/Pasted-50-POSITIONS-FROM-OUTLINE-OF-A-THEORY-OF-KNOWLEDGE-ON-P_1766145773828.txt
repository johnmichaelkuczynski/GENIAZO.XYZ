50 POSITIONS FROM "OUTLINE OF A THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE"

ON PROPOSITIONS AND TRUTH

1. Knowledge is always knowledge of truths, not of objects.

2. A truth is a true proposition; a falsehood is a false proposition.

3. Propositions are not linguistic expressions but what linguistic expressions mean.

4. Propositions are not beliefs but objects of beliefs.

5. Propositions are not identical with any mental entity.

6. Propositions are not facts—they are not spatiotemporal entities.

7. Propositions cannot be physically altered because they are not spatiotemporal.

8. A proposition exists independently of its being true.

9. Truths are not distributions or redistributions of mass-energy.

10. A proposition is a class of properties.

11. For a proposition to be true is for the members of the corresponding property-set to be jointly instantiated.

12. A viable theory of truth must account for both truth-conditions and the internal structural properties of propositions.


ON KNOWLEDGE

13. Falsehoods can be believed but cannot be known.

14. True beliefs must be justified to constitute knowledge.

15. Not all cases of justified true belief are cases of knowledge.

16. Knowledge requires that belief be the end-result of information-transmissive processes.

17. Information-transmissive processes are structure-preservative processes.

18. A belief based on a broken clock is not knowledge even if true and justified, because it lacks structure-preservation.


ON TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE

19. There are two kinds of knowledge: empirical and analytic.

20. Analytic knowledge is knowledge of purely conceptual truths.

21. Empirical truth is observation-based truth.


ON THEORY

22. A theory is an integrated body of propositions describing the structure of a significant domain.

23. True theories apprise us of causal dependence-relations, not logical dependence-relations.

24. Theories explain how multiple causal mechanisms are interrelated, not just single mechanisms.

25. Theoretical knowledge involves inference based on interrelated causal mechanisms.

26. Inferential knowledge based on a single causal mechanism is not theoretical knowledge.


ON CAUSATION

27. Causal connections are real and observable—we do have good reason to believe they exist.

28. The concept of spatial occupancy is inherently causal.

29. The concept of persistence is inherently causal—a thing persists when its present condition is the effect of its previous condition.

30. What we call causal sequences are actually cases of two causal sequences crossing paths.

31. Awareness of anything persistent necessarily involves awareness of causation.

32. To know what causes what, we must know what is continuous with what.

33. Statistical correlations are not themselves causal connections.

34. Correlations only indicate where to look for causal connections; continuity determines actual causation.

35. Causal connections are never known solely by knowing correlations.


AGAINST SKEPTICISM

36. The skeptic's position that we don't see causal connections is erroneous.

37. If skepticism is correct, perceptions have no causes—they come from nothing.

38. The non-skeptic's model posits continuously existing realities; the skeptic's "model" is no explanation at all.

39. A theory positing fewer causal anomalies is better than one positing more (an analytic truth).

40. It is more reasonable to accept the theory with fewer anomalies even if correctness doesn't strictly follow.

41. The skeptic's position is not one of cautious conservatism but radical implausibility.

42. The non-skeptic only needs to be right about one thing; the skeptic must be right about infinitely many independent claims.

43. The skeptic cannot coherently deny that mental states endure and are causally connected.

44. If the skeptic grants causal ties among mental states, his external-world skepticism becomes even more absurd.


ON INDUCTION AND THE FUTURE

45. Discontinuity is harder to explain than continuity.

46. That which comes from nothing is anomalous; that which comes from something is not.

47. The skeptic's claim that something from nothing is no more anomalous than something from something is absurd.

48. One cannot coherently deny that one's own mind persists in time.

49. We know that sometimes something comes from something; we never know that something comes from nothing.

50. The non-skeptic's position is more internally coherent than the skeptic's position.
