1. True knowledge is gained through systematic observation and induction from particulars, whereas mere opinion arises from hasty generalizations or unchecked authority.  
2. The greatest obstacle is the idolatry of the human mind, particularly the idols of the tribe, cave, marketplace, and theatre.  
3. Men cling to ancient authorities because of the idol of the tribe (human nature's love of antiquity) and laziness in seeking new experiences.  
4. Useful knowledge is separated from idle speculation by focusing on operative arts that produce works, not barren disputations.  
5. The idols of the mind deceive thinkers through innate human tendencies, personal biases, ambiguities of language, and false philosophical systems.  
6. Experimentation is essential to discover forms and causes, moving beyond mere observation to controlled trials.  
7. The study of nature reveals God’s works through the book of creation, complementing but not contradicting Scripture.  
8. The syllogism is insufficient because it reasons from premature general axioms rather than ascending gradually from particulars.  
9. One interprets nature correctly by using induction: collecting instances, forming tables, and gradually excluding false causes.  
10. The arts and sciences should be turned operative by applying knowledge to relieve man's estate and produce practical inventions.  
11. Pursuing knowledge for personal glory breeds vain disputations; it should aim at the glory of the Creator and the relief of man's estate.  
12. A philosopher-king must alternate contemplation and action, using wisdom to guide practical affairs without withdrawing entirely from the world.  
13. Knowledge is power because understanding the true forms and causes of things enables men to command nature.  
14. A sound hypothesis is fruitful, producing new works and further discoveries, while a fanciful one remains barren.  
15. Tables of presence, absence, and degrees allow one to isolate the true form by systematic comparison and exclusion.  
16. The Schoolmen’s philosophy retarded progress by excessive disputation, reliance on syllogism, and neglect of experience.  
17. Modern statesmen should learn from Rome the arts of managing ambition, preventing seditions, and balancing expansion with stability.  
18. A prince cultivates truthful counselors by rewarding plain speech, avoiding flatterers, and seeking advice privately.  
19. Dissimulation is sometimes necessary in state affairs to conceal intentions when open declaration would provoke danger.  
20. Monarchy is stronger because it provides unity of command, swift decision-making, and clearer accountability than divided governments.  
21. Ambition can be harnessed by directing it toward public service and rewarding merit rather than allowing it to breed faction.  
22. The chief causes of sedition are discontent from poverty or oppression, contempt for authority, and innovations that unsettle the people.  
23. Men mistake appearance for virtue because reputation often depends on outward show rather than inner moral habit.  
24. Fortune resembles the market because opportunities fluctuate unpredictably; one negotiates her by boldness tempered with prudence.  
25. Reason and revelation are compatible: reason governs second causes in nature, while revelation addresses divine mysteries.  
26. Human reason cannot fully comprehend divine mysteries but can confirm faith through the light of nature.  
27. The plain style is preferable because it conveys truth clearly without the veils and ornaments that obscure meaning.  
28. Histories should be written critically, with attention to causes and patterns, to serve as the raw material for philosophy.  
29. Universities hinder learning by clinging to outdated methods, excessive disputation, and neglect of experiment and modern authors.  
30. A “House of Salomon” should organize research through systematic collaboration, dedicated experimenters, and cumulative records.  
31. Induction is superior because it proceeds patiently from particulars to axioms, avoiding the mind's tendency to leap prematurely.  
32. Precautions against hasty generalization include exhaustive tables, prerogative instances, and gradual ascent through axioms.  
33. Real causes are distinguished from coincidences by varying conditions systematically and noting constant presence or absence.  
34. Heat and motion reveal fundamental forms because they are primary qualities underlying many natural phenomena.  
35. Alchemy and astrology are corrupted because they mix superstition and fantasy with legitimate inquiry into transmutation and influences.  
36. Human learning should be classified into memory (history), imagination (poetry), and reason (philosophy), with many subdivisions.  
37. Poetry holds a legitimate place as a divine gift that feigns what reason and history cannot fully express.  
38. The understanding rushes to axioms because of human impatience and the desire for certainty without sufficient particulars.  
39. Prerogative instances illuminate hidden processes by revealing extreme cases, borderline phenomena, or crucial turning points.  
40. Negotiation is a higher art than force because it achieves ends with less cost and preserves future alliances.  
41. It is wiser to delay vengeance because time cools passion and allows justice to take its proper course.  
42. Envy undermines individuals and commonwealths by breeding faction, malice, and the obstruction of merit.  
43. The most essential virtues in a chief minister are fidelity, prudence, experience, and the courage to speak unwelcome truths.  
44. Great men fall through overconfidence by despising small dangers and refusing counsel from inferiors.  
45. A ruler manages factions by balancing them against each other, rewarding moderates, and preventing any one from dominating.  
46. Ceremony maintains majesty by creating distance and reverence, which strengthen authority without real power.  
47. Rapid expansion is dangerous because it overextends resources, breeds discontent among subjects, and invites rebellion.  
48. Laws prevent corruption by clear prohibitions, severe but certain penalties, and removal of opportunities for private gain.  
49. True greatness of mind consists in bending one's powers to public good, not in vainglory or self-aggrandizement.  
50. Men admire antiquity excessively because of reverence for the past and neglect of the superiority of modern discoveries.  
51. Printing, gunpowder, and the compass have changed warfare, learning, and navigation more than any ancient empire or sect.  
52. Mixing religion and politics endangers both: it breeds fanaticism in the state and hypocrisy in the church.  
53. Moderation in punishment is often more effective because it preserves fear without breeding desperation or hatred.  
54. Books should be read selectively: some tasted, some chewed, some fully digested, according to their worth.  
55. Cunning differs from wisdom as a shortcut differs from the true path; it may succeed temporarily but lacks lasting fruit.  
56. Bold undertakings sometimes succeed because fortune favors the audacious and men are inspired by great designs.  
57. A private man rises safely by attaching himself to a rising favorite, showing merit without envy, and timing his advances.  
58. Friendship is one of the highest goods because it doubles joys, halves griefs, and provides honest counsel.  
59. Travel in youth is more profitable because the mind is still forming and impressions are deeper than in settled age.  
60. Gardens should be designed with variety, symmetry, and rare plants to delight the senses and instruct the understanding.  
61. Judging buildings only by magnificence errs by neglecting convenience, health, and proportion to use.  
62. Anger is a kind of baseness because it shows weakness of mind unable to bear slight injuries patiently.  
63. Adversity reveals character more clearly because prosperity flatters everyone, while hardship tests true virtue.  
64. The proper limit of human empire over nature is to command second causes while acknowledging divine sovereignty.  
65. Superstitions persist among learned men because the mind naturally seeks patterns and fears the unknown.  
66. Profitable innovations are distinguished by gradual introduction and proof of public benefit; dangerous novelties unsettle customs.  
67. Counsel is the purest form of goodness because it benefits others without personal gain or risk.  
68. It is folly to attempt everything at once in reform; changes must be gradual to avoid resistance and confusion.  
69. A commonwealth balances liberty and authority by laws that protect subjects while preserving the prince's prerogative.  
70. Aristotle’s natural philosophy most needs correction in its teleological excesses and neglect of systematic experiment.  
71. Men fear death more than they ought because imagination magnifies it and custom blinds them to its familiarity.  
72. Custom makes absurd things seem natural by habituating the mind and dulling judgment.  
73. Mathematics should play a foundational role in natural philosophy as the most certain measure of quantity and motion.  
74. Studying secondary causes is compatible with piety because it unveils God's workmanship without presuming on final causes.  
75. One avoids distortion by suspending judgment until full induction is complete and by using tables to challenge preconceptions.  
76. A proposition is fruitful if it leads to new experiments and practical effects, not merely verbal disputes.  
77. Disputes in philosophy rarely resolve because parties cling to systems rather than seeking common ground in experience.  
78. The history of nature (pure phenomena) must be separated from the history of arts (human modifications) for clarity.  
79. Writing in aphorisms offers advantages by presenting knowledge in a disconnected form that provokes thought and avoids dogmatism.  
80. The mechanical arts are a surer guide because they accumulate reliable experiments and produce real effects.  
81. Subtle degrees of change are detected by precise instruments and careful records over time.  
82. Inquiry into final causes is barren in physics because it diverts attention from efficient and material causes.  
83. Men praise solitude in theory yet flee it because human nature craves society and fears self-examination.  
84. A ruler uses spies sparingly and selectively to avoid breeding universal distrust and undermining open counsel.  
85. True piety is separated from hypocritical zeal by inward devotion and outward charity, not ostentatious display.  
86. It is dangerous to innovate suddenly in church matters because religion is deeply rooted in custom and reverence.  
87. Praise corrupts more subtly than blame by inflating vanity and weakening self-judgment.  
88. Old age is often more prudent yet less inventive because experience tempers judgment but imagination fades.  
89. Empires decline after their zenith through luxury, corruption, loss of martial virtue, and overextension.  
90. Judgment is cultivated without stifling imagination by grounding fancy in experience and reason.  
91. The proper relation is that experience supplies the particulars while reason orders and interprets them.  
92. Men readily believe what they wish because the understanding is more moved by affirmatives than negatives.  
93. The advancement of learning should be funded by royal patronage, endowments, and collaborative institutions.  
94. Over-refinement of knowledge endangers by breeding endless subtleties and detachment from practical utility.  
95. Unity of command is essential in great enterprises to ensure swift execution and clear responsibility.  
96. The contemplative and active lives are reconciled by alternating periods of study with service to the commonwealth.  
97. Some lies are more harmful than open violence because they undermine trust, the foundation of society.  
98. Revolutions in knowledge proceed slowly because they require accumulation of observations, not mere political will.  
99. Posterity should judge present discoveries by their fruitfulness in new works and lasting benefit to mankind.  
100. The one principle is to approach nature humbly, through gradual induction from particulars, purging the mind of idols and anticipations.
