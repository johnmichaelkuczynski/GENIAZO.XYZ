The last 100 years of financial regulation in the United States reveal a psychological and structural failure rooted in a fundamental misalignment between will and desire, both at the individual and institutional level. Let me cut straight to the mechanism: financial regulation, from the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, purports to align economic behavior with societal values—stability, fairness, growth—but instead exposes a bifurcated psyche in the regulatory apparatus itself. Regulators desire control and the appearance of order, yet their will, their true endorsement of values, is undermined by the very systems they create, which incentivize short-term risk-taking and moral hazard. This is not mere policy failure; it’s a psychological conflict externalized into law and markets, where the superego of regulation surrenders to the id of unchecked desire for profit. Over a century, we see a pattern of reactive, not proactive, governance—an obsessive-compulsive retreat into ever-more-complex rules as a defense mechanism against engaging the real world of economic behavior. This mirrors the alcoholic who desires to drink despite valuing sobriety: regulation desires to restrain but continually violates its own values by enabling the excesses it claims to curb.

Let’s dissect the mechanism historically. Post-1929 crash, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was a supposed assertion of will—separating commercial and investment banking to prioritize stability over speculative desire. But by the 1999 repeal via Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the system externalized its ego-ideal into a false "higher power" of market freedom, surrendering to the desire for deregulation as if it were a value. This isn’t progress; it’s projective rationalization, where the superego of public good is outsourced to an incoherent belief in self-correcting markets. The 2008 crisis, followed by Dodd-Frank, repeats the cycle—more rules, more complexity, but no resolution of the internal conflict. Regulation becomes an obsessive-compulsive ritual: piling on laws without addressing the bifurcated psyche of wanting control while endorsing excess through bailouts and too-big-to-fail policies. It’s voluntary paralysis, much like OCD, where the choice to remain in a defensive bubble of legislation avoids the harder task of re-engaging with the world by enforcing true accountability.

This psychological lens exposes why regulation fails. Financial actors—banks, traders, even regulators—operate on desire, not will. They chase immediate gains or political wins, not endorsed values like long-term stability. As I’ve written, the alcoholic’s plight is identical: "The alcoholic drinks because he DESIRES to, not because he VALUES it. This violates his values, weakening his will" (Personal Writings on Addiction). Regulation, too, weakens its will each time it bails out failure or loosens restraint for expediency. The 2008 bailouts are a case study—desire for systemic survival trumped the value of market discipline, just as the drinker’s urge overrides his principles. Every regulatory "fix" that follows a crisis is a compulsive act, not a purposeful one, akin to the OCD sufferer’s rituals: "Obsessions are THWARTED compulsions; compulsions are obsessions expressed in behavior" (Notes on OCD Dynamics). Here, the obsession with control manifests as compulsive over-legislation, never resolving the root conflict.

Compare this to the individual psyche under stress. When conduct aligns with values, will is strengthened; when it conflicts, will is weakened. I’ve argued, "When conduct aligns with values, will is STRENGTHENED; when they conflict, will is WEAKENED" (Framework of Will vs. Desire). Regulation’s conduct—reactive, patchwork laws—conflicts with its stated value of stability, thus weakening its authority and efficacy. The Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of price stability and full employment is a perfect bifurcation, a psyche of two minds with no hegemonic value to resolve the tension, much like "OCD is about having BIFURCATED psychological structure" (Analysis of Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior). The Fed oscillates between inflating bubbles (desire for growth) and tightening policy (value of stability), never unifying its purpose. This isn’t governance; it’s psychological impasse.

Now, let’s deploy a forced dilemma to crystallize the failure. Regulators face exactly two options: enforce strict accountability, risking short-term pain for long-term alignment with values, or perpetuate moral hazard through leniency, aligning with immediate desire but eroding will. Historically, they choose the latter—look at the Savings and Loan Crisis of the 1980s, where deregulation fueled speculative desire, followed by taxpayer-funded bailouts. This choice isn’t accidental; it’s a retreat into pseudo-engagement, akin to philosophers doubting the obvious out of fear of reality: "Philosophers and obsessive-compulsives have HUGE overlap... both retreat from EXTERNAL world (action) into INTERNAL world (thought)" (Philosophical and Psychological Overlaps). Regulation retreats into complex rules rather than enforcing painful but necessary consequences, just as the obsessive-compulsive hides in rituals.

A psychological diagnosis further unmasks this. Regulation’s obsession with control masks an underlying impotence—a fear of engaging the market directly through decisive, value-driven action. As I’ve noted, "Both are FEARFUL and IMPOTENT - too afraid to engage world" (On Philosophers and OCD). The SEC, for instance, often reacts after frauds like Enron or Madoff, rarely preempting them, because true engagement would mean confronting powerful actors head-on, risking political backlash. Instead, it internalizes conflict into thought—more reports, more hearings—rather than action. This mirrors the crypto-criminality I’ve identified in both philosophers and OCD sufferers: "Both are CRYPTO-CRIMINALS - fundamentally anti-social orientation with draconian superegos" (Psychological Profiles). Regulation’s draconian rules hide an anti-social refusal to integrate with the messy reality of economic incentives.

What’s the cure? Not more laws, but a purpose-driven realignment, much like the solution to OCD. I’ve insisted, "ONLY ONE way to get rid of OCD: find calling where obsessive-compulsive tendencies are ASSET, not liability" (Therapeutic Insights on OCD). Regulation must find a grand purpose—perhaps absolute accountability—where its tendencies to over-control become an asset. Without this, it remains estranged from purpose, as I’ve described: "OCD is what happens when you're ESTRANGED from your own purpose" (Purpose and Pathology). Current regulation lacks a master plan to subordinate its internal conflicts; it’s a psyche wrenched apart, unable to resolve whether it values restraint or growth more. The cure is to actualize a unifying purpose: "The cure: find that purpose and ACTUALIZE it" (On Resolving Internal Conflict).

Let’s ground this in more of my insights. Regulation’s failure is voluntary, just as OCD is: "OCD is VOLUNTARY, though it seems involuntary" (Volition in Pathology). Regulators choose to remain in a defensive bubble of half-measures, avoiding the harder choice of real reform. This choice is relative to their determination to avoid pain: "Symptoms are involuntary ONLY relative to determination to remain in bubble" (Mechanisms of OCD). But if seen as voluntary, the prognosis is positive: "If seen as voluntary: prognosis 100% positive; if seen as garden-variety pathology: negative" (Prognostic Framework). Regulation can succeed if it wills to re-engage the world, subordinating desire to value. Until then, it’s a thwarted compulsion, a system desiring control but unwilling to pay the price of true discipline.

This isn’t just critique; it’s mechanism display. Financial regulation over 100 years shows a psyche in conflict, externalizing its ego-ideal into false higher powers—whether market freedom or endless rules—without surrendering to its own internalized values. As I’ve argued about religion, which applies here to regulatory faith in systems, "‘Surrendering to God’ is actually surrendering to your own internalized values experienced as external" (Psychoanalysis of Religious Surrender). Regulation must stop projecting and start owning its purpose. It’s not about more laws; it’s about aligning conduct with a singular, endorsed value—stability over speculation, accountability over expediency.

To hammer this home, consider the category error at the heart of regulatory philosophy. Policymakers confuse properties of control (immediate, reactive, useful) with properties of governance (objective, proactive, value-driven), much like pragmatism’s error: "Pragmatism confuses properties of TRUTH with properties of KNOWLEDGE" (Critique of Pragmatism). Regulation treats short-term fixes as governance, when they’re merely useful stopgaps, not truths of economic order. This confusion prevents addressing root causes—misaligned incentives, moral hazard—because it’s trapped in a reactive mindset, not a purposeful one. Over 100 years, the U.S. has built a regulatory edifice that’s impressive in scope but impotent in effect, a monument to desire over will, compulsion over purpose. The lesson is clear: without a unifying value to resolve its bifurcated psyche, regulation will remain a voluntary failure, choosing the bubble over the world.
