WHAT IS LOGIC?

Logic, in my view, is not a direct description of how we actually think but rather a normative framework prescribing how we ought to think to achieve rational coherence. The relationship between logic and psychology is thus one of tension: psychology studies the empirical messiness of human thought—its biases, heuristics, and emotional influences—while logic provides a structured ideal that thought should aspire to. I see logic as a tool, not a mirror of mental processes, because human cognition often operates through pattern recognition and holistic processing, which don't neatly align with the step-by-step deductions of classical logic.

Consider the psychological reality of thinking. Most people don't reason through explicit syllogisms or formal inference rules in daily life; instead, they rely on intuitive pattern recognition, as I’ve argued in my work on rationality. As I’ve written, "Pattern recognition gets promoted: Actual mechanism of rational thought, operates in deduction, induction, abduction, perception." This suggests that the core of human rationality isn't formal deduction but a more fluid, context-sensitive process that logic only partially captures.

If logic is normative, not descriptive, then its authority must be grounded in something beyond mere observation of thought. I hold that its authority comes from its capacity to systematize and verify reasoning, ensuring consistency and predictability in our conclusions. Logic's rules, such as those of inference I discuss in my axiomatic systems, provide a scaffold for thought that transcends subjective error. As I’ve noted, "These rules of inference constitute the major part of the principles of formal logic." This scaffolding is what allows us to build reliable knowledge, even if our natural thinking deviates from it.

But this normative authority isn't absolute or unassailable. Logic's prescriptive power is justified only insofar as it serves the practical end of coherent thought—when it fails to account for the psychological mechanisms of pattern-based reasoning or context-sensitivity, as in AI systems I’ve analyzed, its limits are exposed. Logic, then, must be seen as a constructed ideal, not a universal law of mind, with its authority rooted in utility for rational discourse rather than in mirroring how we inherently think.
