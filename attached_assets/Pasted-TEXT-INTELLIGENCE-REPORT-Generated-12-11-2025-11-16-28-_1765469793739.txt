--- MAJOR VIEWS ---
1. VIEW: A maximally great thing exists in reality if it exists in the mind
   EVIDENCE: "It is therefore incoherent to suppose that a maximally great thing exists in my mind but not also in reality."

2. VIEW: A maximally great thing exists
   EVIDENCE: "Conclusion: a maximally great thing exists."

3. VIEW: God exists
   EVIDENCE: "In other words, God exists."

4. VIEW: AG is a spurious argument
   EVIDENCE: "AG is a spurious argument."

5. VIEW: God does not exist in the mind
   EVIDENCE: "Correctly interpreted, MG doesn't say that God exists in my mind."

6. VIEW: If God exists, She is out there, in the world, not in the mind
   EVIDENCE: "If God exists, She is out there, in the world, not in my mind."

7. VIEW: No idea of mine is God
   EVIDENCE: "No idea of mine is God."

8. VIEW: The only things that exist in the mind are thoughts, feelings, etc.
   EVIDENCE: "The only things that exist in my mind are thoughts, feelings, etc."

9. VIEW: The fact that a representation of the Sun exists in the mind does not entail that the Sun itself exists in the mind
   EVIDENCE: "But the fact that a representation of the Sun exists in my mind obviously doesn't entail that the Sun itself exists in my mind."

10. VIEW: MG says that the author knows how a thing must be if it is to be maximally great
   EVIDENCE: "Correctly interpreted, MG says that I know how a thing must be if it is to be maximally great."

11. VIEW: Having knowledge of what conditions a thing must fulfill to be maximally great does not imply the existence of such a thing
   EVIDENCE: "But given only that I have this knowledge, it doesn't follow that there exists anything that has any of the requisite properties."

12. VIEW: AG goes through only if there exists something with the properties specific to God
   EVIDENCE: "AG goes through only if there exists something that has these properties."

13. VIEW: The italicized statement must guarantee the existence of a thing with God's properties
   EVIDENCE: "The italicized statement must guarantee that there is such a thing; otherwise the argument collapses."

14. VIEW: The argument collapses because the italicized statement does not guarantee the existence of a thing with God's properties
   EVIDENCE: "It doesn't, and the argument collapses."

15. VIEW: God is a maximally excellent thing by definition
   EVIDENCE: "God is a maximally excellent thing. Explanation: Just as squares are, by definition, four-sided, so God is, by definition, maximally excellent."

16. VIEW: If an object is deficient in any way, it fails to be God
   EVIDENCE: "If we found that object X was deficient in some way-that it was ill-willed or stupid or lazy-then it would, for that very reason, fail to be God."

17. VIEW: God has all excellences to the highest degree because he is maximally excellent
   EVIDENCE: "Because he is a maximally excellent thing, God has all excellences, and he has them to the highest degree."

18. VIEW: Existence is an excellence
   EVIDENCE: "Existence is an excellence."

19. VIEW: Failing to exist is the worst kind of failure
   EVIDENCE: "But no failure is as bad as the failure to exist."

20. VIEW: If you don't exist, you are a complete and total zero
   EVIDENCE: "If you don't exist, you are a nothing, a complete and total zero, and you are therefore a nothing compared to anyone-even the biggest loser you know."

21. VIEW: God must have existence because existence is an excellence
   EVIDENCE: "Conclusion: God must have existence. God is, by definition, maximally excellent and therefore has every excellence. Since existence is an excellence, it follows that God has existence."

22. VIEW: The ontological argument appears to beg the question
   EVIDENCE: "But the ontological argument appears to do just this."

23. VIEW: The problem with the ontological argument lies in the first two steps
   EVIDENCE: "The problem lies in the first two steps."

24. VIEW: Step 1 of the ontological argument is another way of saying that God exists
   EVIDENCE: "Step 1 is just another way of saying: Step 1*: There exists a certain thing, namely God, which is maximally excellent."

25. VIEW: Step 2 of the ontological argument is another way of saying that God exists with every excellence
   EVIDENCE: "And Step 2 is a way of saying: Step 2*: There exists a certain thing, namely God, which, because he is maximally excellent, has every excellence to the highest possible degree."

26. VIEW: The ontological argument fails to prove God's existence if it assumes God exists
   EVIDENCE: "But if Steps 1 and 2 are taken in this way, then the argument question-beggingly assumes that God exists, and thus fails to prove it."

27. VIEW: Steps 1 and 2 must be interpreted to not assume God's existence for the ontological argument to be valid
   EVIDENCE: "So, if the Ontological argument is to go through, Steps 1 and 2 must be interpreted in such a way that they don't assume that God exists."

28. VIEW: If God existed, She would be a most excellent being
   EVIDENCE: "Step 1#: If God existed, then She would be a most excellent being."

29. VIEW: If God existed, God would have every excellence to a maximally high degree
   EVIDENCE: "Step 2#: If God existed, then God would have every excellence to a maximally high degree."

30. VIEW: The ontological argument must replace Steps 1 and 2 with Steps #1 and #2 to avoid begging the question
   EVIDENCE: "So the first three steps must become: Step 1#. If God existed, She would be a most excellent being. Step 2#: If God existed, then God would have every excellence to a maximally high degree."

31. VIEW: If God exists, then He has every excellence, including existence
   EVIDENCE: "What follows from these three statements is that: Conclusion*: If God exists, then He has every excellence, including existence."

32. VIEW: If God exists, She exists
   EVIDENCE: "In other words, if God exists, She exists."

33. VIEW: The ontological argument proves nothing
   EVIDENCE: "So the ontological argument proves nothing."

34. VIEW: Failing to exist is a way of being imperfect
   EVIDENCE: "Failing to exist is a way of being imperfect."

35. VIEW: God is perfect
   EVIDENCE: "God is perfect."

36. VIEW: God doesn't fail to exist
   EVIDENCE: "Therefore, God doesn't fail to exist."

37. VIEW: SOA presupposes that a given thing's failing to exist makes it imperfect
   EVIDENCE: "SOA presupposes that a given thing's failing to exist makes it imperfect."

38. VIEW: SOA presupposes that a given thing can fail to exist
   EVIDENCE: "SOA therefore presupposes that a given thing can fail to exist."

39. VIEW: It's incoherent to say that failing to exist makes you a lesser person
   EVIDENCE: "But it's incoherent. If you didn't exist, you wouldn't be a lesser person."

40. VIEW: If you didn't exist, there would be no you to begin with
   EVIDENCE: "If you didn't exist, you wouldn't be a lesser person. There would be no you to begin with; and there would thus"

41. VIEW: It is not possible for something to fail to exist
   EVIDENCE: "For there to be something that failed to exist would be for there to exist something x such that x did not exist. And that, clearly, is not possible."

42. VIEW: The statement 'square circles don't exist' means that no object can be both a square and a circle
   EVIDENCE: "Rather, SC says that (SC*) any given thing is a non-square if it's a circle."

43. VIEW: The statement 'Zeus doesn't exist' means that no object has the properties attributed to Zeus
   EVIDENCE: "ZE makes the innocuous claim that given any object x, x doesn't have the property of being a unique, lightning-bolt hurling god [etc.]."

44. VIEW: Statements about non-existence attribute properties to properties, not non-existence to objects
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, SC and ZE attribute properties to properties. They don't attribute non-existence to objects."

45. VIEW: The statement 'square circles do exist' means that the set of circles overlaps with that of squares
   EVIDENCE: "Rather, CS is to the effect that: (MCS1) it isn't true that everything that is a square isn't also a circle or, alternatively, (MCS2) the set of circles overlaps with that of squares."

46. VIEW: The statement 'Zeus exists' means that something has the properties attributed to Zeus
   EVIDENCE: "Rather EZ is to the effect that: (MEZ) it isn't true of any given thing x that x doesn't uniquely have the property of being something that lives on Mt. Olympus and hurls lightning bolts [etc.]."

47. VIEW: It is not possible to attribute non-existence to a non-existent object
   EVIDENCE: "It isn't even possible to attribute non-existence to a non-existent object. One's doing would so would involve there existing some non-existent object to which one attributed non-existence. But that isn't possible."

48. VIEW: It is not possible to attribute existence to a non-existent object
   EVIDENCE: "Nor is it possible to attribute existence to a non-existent object. One's doing so would involve there existing some non-existent object to which one attributed existence. But that isn't possible."

49. VIEW: Nothing to which existence or non-existence is attributed is non-existent
   EVIDENCE: "Thus, nothing to which existence or non-existence is attributed is non-existent."

50. VIEW: The claim that nothing to which existence or non-existence is attributed is non-existent is identical to the truth that no object x exists such that existence or non-existence is attributed to x and x doesn't exist
   EVIDENCE: "This is a pretty innocuous claim, as it's identical with the obvious truth that there is no object x such that existence or non-existence is attributed to x and such that x doesn't exist."

51. VIEW: A precondition for a thing's being described as existent or non-existent is its existing
   EVIDENCE: "It follows that a precondition for a thing's being described as existent or non-existent is its existing."

52. VIEW: There is no negation of the proposition one affirms when describing a given object as existent
   EVIDENCE: "This means that, if P is the proposition one affirms when one describes a given object as existent, there is no negation of P."

53. VIEW: In attributing existence to a given thing, one isn't affirming anything
   EVIDENCE: "Since any given proposition can be negated, it follows that, in attributing existence to a given thing, one isn't affirming anything."

54. VIEW: It is meaningless to say of specific individuals that they exist or don't exist
   EVIDENCE: "It is meaningless to say of specific individuals that they exist or don't exist."

55. VIEW: Ethical judgments are influenced by our cultures and upbringings
   EVIDENCE: "our cultures and upbringings"

56. VIEW: Claiming ethical judgments are by-products of upbringing denies their objectivity
   EVIDENCE: "if you say that our ethical judgments are by-products of our upbringing, and therefore aren't hewed to anything objective"

57. VIEW: Denying the objectivity of ethical judgments undermines one's right to assert any judgments
   EVIDENCE: "then you are ipso facto denying that your judgments are any good, in which case you forfeit your right to assert anything"

58. VIEW: Divine Command Theory (DCT) prevails against identified problems
   EVIDENCE: "say why, in your judgment, DCT prevails against all of problems that have been identified"

59. VIEW: St. Thomas Aquinas argued against DCT
   EVIDENCE: "St. Thomas Aquinas (who lived in the 13th century) argues against DCT"

60. VIEW: It is heresy in the Catholic Church to accept DCT since Aquinas' time
   EVIDENCE: "Since Aquinas' time, it has been heresy in the Catholic Church to accept DCT"

61. VIEW: One can reject DCT and still be religious
   EVIDENCE: "this strongly suggests that, contrary to what I said in Section 1.6, one can reject DCT and be religious"

62. VIEW: Aquinas believed that to be genuinely religious, one must reject DCT
   EVIDENCE: "Aquinas argues that, to be genuinely religious, one must reject DCT"

63. VIEW: Aquinas was not religious to the extent he rejected DCT
   EVIDENCE: "My feeling is that to the extent that Aquinas rejected DCT, he wasn't religious"

64. VIEW: Aquinas accepted DCT to the extent he was religious
   EVIDENCE: "to the extent that he was religious, he actually did accept DCT"

65. VIEW: Religious intellectuals are masters of compartmentalization
   EVIDENCE: "Religious intellectuals are masters of compartmentalization"

66. VIEW: One of the theodicies discussed presupposes the existence of free will
   EVIDENCE: "One of the two theodicies that we discussed presupposes that there is such a thing as free will"

67. VIEW: It is questionable whether there is such a thing as free will
   EVIDENCE: "Then say why it is questionable whether there is such a thing as free will"

68. VIEW: Free will, if it exists, may not necessarily help the theodicy in question
   EVIDENCE: "Also say why, supposing that there is free will, it wouldn't necessarily help the theodicy in question"

69. VIEW: God is omniscient
   EVIDENCE: "According to many, God is omniscient"

70. VIEW: God's omniscience implies knowledge of all actions of every person
   EVIDENCE: "Given that God is omniscient, He/She has always known exactly what each person-past, present, and future- would do at each moment of his/her life"

71. VIEW: God's omniscience could imply a lack of free will
   EVIDENCE: "Does this mean that you have no free will?"

72. VIEW: The free-will theodicy presupposes God's omniscience and knowledge of the future
   EVIDENCE: "The free-will theodicy presupposes that God is omniscient and therefore knows exactly what the future holds"

73. VIEW: God's knowledge of future actions challenges the concept of free will
   EVIDENCE: "But if Gods knows now what I will do 10 years from now, it's hard to see how I could possibly have any free will"

74. VIEW: The Free Will defense leads to the paradox of both having and not having free will
   EVIDENCE: "The Free Will defense thus seems to have the absurd consequence that people both do, and do not, have free will"

75. VIEW: Proponents of the Free Will defense have substantial arguments
   EVIDENCE: "Say what a proponent of the Free Will defense might say in response to this charge. Make sure that the argument that you attribute to this person is substantial"

76. VIEW: Descartes believed that an omnipotent God can make 1 + 1 = 3
   EVIDENCE: "According to Descartes, God, being omnipotent, can make 1 + 1 = 3"

77. VIEW: Wittgenstein believed that even an omnipotent God cannot make 1 + 1 = 3
   EVIDENCE: "According to Wittgenstein, even if God is omnipotent, He/She cannot make 1 + 1 = 3"
