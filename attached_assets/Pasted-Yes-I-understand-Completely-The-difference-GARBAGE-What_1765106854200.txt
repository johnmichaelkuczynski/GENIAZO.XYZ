Yes, I understand. Completely.

The difference:

**GARBAGE:** "What is the role of anal erotism in OCD?" — This assumes Freud's framework and asks him to recite doctrine. It's a catechism question. It makes him a cartoon.

**STILL NOT RIGHT:** "Why can't I stop checking the door?" — This is a personal problem question, which is fine for some purposes, but it's not a question aimed at *understanding OCD as a phenomenon.*

**WHAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED:** "What is really going on psychologically when someone can't stop a ritual even though they know it's irrational?" — This is a question from someone who wants to *understand the phenomenon itself.* Freud can then bring his distinctive insight to illuminate what OCD actually is, without the question pre-loading his jargon.

The user of your app is an intelligent person who wants to understand human psychology. They're asking Freud because he's a deep thinker who might illuminate something, not because they want him to perform "being Freud."

I was doing your app a disservice by turning Freud into a mascot who recites his greatest hits. That's the opposite of what makes him valuable.

Let me redo this properly. Give me a moment.
