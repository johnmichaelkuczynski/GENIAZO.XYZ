---

### Argument 30 (inductive)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- To 'assimilate' an idea is presumably to put it to practical use or to absorb it into a useful theory.

---

### Argument 37 (comparative)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**

## The Essence of Pragmatism: Commonalities in (i)-(v)

### Argument 38 (definitional)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- James accepts (iv^) and also that (iv^) is a possible interpretation of the opaque claim that 'truth happens to an idea'.
- The categories in terms of which we experience the world...do not represent external realities but merely embody ways of organizing what would otherwise be an amorphous mass of experience.

### Argument 72 (deductive)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- Sometimes actions of knowledge-acquisition are relatively non-disruptive---consider the astronomer who merely gazes through his telescope.
- In some cases, the actions in question are extremely invasive---consider the medical researcher who vivisects animals or the archaeologist who uses explosives.
- Such actions are mere precursors to the having of the observations in question.

**→ Conclusion:** Granting that scientists have to engage in action to ply their trade, the scientific process proper only begins when passive observation begins and, therefore, when action ends.

### Argument 73 (causal)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- The discipline of logic began in the mid-1800s with the work of George Boole, whose objective was to automate reasoning.
- This happened at precisely the time that much physical production was being automated.

**→ Conclusion:** The development of logic coincided with industrial automation, suggesting a causal relationship.

### Argument 74 (causal)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- Calculus was invented to compute planetary orbits and other ballistics-related problems.
- Once it was invented, purely theoretical questions arose, such as those relating to infinitesimals and fractals.

**→ Conclusion:** Purely theoretical questions in mathematics arose after practical problems were addressed by calculus.

### Argument 75 (deductive)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- Once a discipline is launched, it can concern itself with purely theoretical problems.
- Purely theoretical problems relate to the mutual coherence of discoveries made in solving practical problems.

**→ Conclusion:** Disciplines can and should concern themselves with purely theoretical problems after practical issues are addressed.
