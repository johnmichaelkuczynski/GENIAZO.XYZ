POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM KUCZYNSKI, CHAPTER 1
POSITIONS

Philosophy studies the categories (person, fact, causation, knowledge, truth) through which we understand the world—it doesn't study the world directly.
We are excellent at using fundamental categories but terrible at making them explicit—we can distinguish knowledge from mere belief without being able to say what the difference is.
The philosopher is to the physicist what the physicist is to the engineer—each studies the conditions underlying what the other takes for granted.
Philosophical knowledge is metaknowledge: knowledge about knowledge, not knowledge about things.
Pre-Fregean philosophers thought they were studying general features of the actual world; Frege showed they were studying what could possibly be the case.
Philosophical puzzles result from confusion, not ignorance—they're solved by drawing the right inferences from what's already known, not by discovering new facts.
"Nothing is a square circle" doesn't attribute being-a-square-circle to some non-entity; it says the property of being a square circle is uninstantiated.
Philosophical problems are solved by clarifying statements, not by positing new entities.
Grammatical form and logical form can diverge radically—the surface structure of a sentence may misrepresent what it actually says.
Quantified statements ("someone smokes," "nothing is round") are really statements about properties, not about mysterious non-specific objects.
Analytic philosophers are ontologically conservative—they don't grant existence to anything whose existence hasn't been demonstrated beyond doubt.
Pre-Fregean philosophers ontologized when they should have analyzed—they posited bizarre entities to cover up defects in their analyses.
When ontologizing is necessary, the entities posited are always abstract objects required to account for obviously true statements.
Properties exist and are non-spatiotemporal—you'll never encounter redness itself, only instances of it.
Perception is description: seeing something involves seeing that various properties are instantiated in a certain place.
The content of a perception is an existence-claim—a claim that certain properties are instantiated.
Hallucinations don't represent non-existent objects; they encode false existence-claims.
Nothing non-existent or quasi-existent can be the object of thought or perception.
Brentano and Meinong were ontologizing when they should have been analyzing—their talk of "subsistent" entities was spurious.
Propositions are properties—for a proposition to be true is for it to be instantiated (for the world to have that property).
Propositions exist independently of human beings—the world was a certain way before we existed.
Sentences are human artifacts, but the truths they express are not.
The term "statement" is ambiguous—it can refer to propositions, sentences, or acts of affirming.
Not all philosophical analysis is linguistic analysis—many philosophical puzzles have nothing to do with language.
Wittgenstein was wrong that all philosophical problems arise from misusing language.
Some philosophical disputes concern whether a meaningful statement is true, not what it means.
Wittgenstein's "meaning is use" thesis is incoherent—we can't know which word to study without already grasping the concept independently of the word.
If meaning were use, meaning couldn't guide use—but it obviously does.
To the extent meaning doesn't guide use, people are misspeaking—use presupposes meaning, not vice versa.
For something to be a linguistic expression at all, it must have meaning—noises without meaning are just noises.
Speaking consists in making noises because one believes they have certain meanings according to semantic rules.
Any correct generalization about when abstract terms like "justice" are used will itself employ the concepts those terms express.
The analysis of sentences is really the analysis of semantic rules—and semantic rules are not themselves sentences.
The thesis that philosophy is sentence-analysis either collapses into linguistics or into the analysis of concepts.
Wittgenstein's Tractarian claim that all philosophical statements are ungrammatical nonsense is self-refuting.
Ungrammatical sentences are often perfectly meaningful ("me and Herby play tennis every day").
The problem with "the good is more identical than the beautiful" isn't bad grammar—it's that "more identical than" denotes no relation.
Meaninglessness results from undefined terms, not grammatical violations.
The statement that all philosophical statements are meaningless is itself a philosophical statement—so if true, it's false.
Logical positivism says a sentence is meaningful iff it's either a tautology or an empirical statement.
Verificationism is false—"all metal expands when heated" is meaningful but cannot be conclusively verified.
Falsificationism is false—"there exists a gold ball weighing exactly 27.13654 lbs" is meaningful but cannot be conclusively falsified.
Confirmationalism fails because meaningless sentences can follow from confirmable ones.
Logical positivism is neither tautologous nor empirical—so by its own criterion, it's meaningless and therefore false.
Empiricism is self-refuting: you can't know through observation that all knowledge is observation-based.
Observation cannot tell you whether one statement is consistent or inconsistent with another.
The consistency of conventions is not itself a matter of convention.
What must be the case cannot be known through observation—observation tells only what is the case.
There are non-empirical truths that have nothing to do with linguistic conventions.
From tautologous premises (definitions of "triangle" and "pentagon"), non-tautologous truths can be derived.
Goodman's grue argument shows that induction does not have a strictly observational basis.
Some properties (like green) are inductively relevant and others (like grue) are not—but observation alone can't tell which.
A priori knowledge is required to learn from experience at all.
Tautologousness is a property of utterances in context, not of sentences per se.
The same sentence can be trivial for one person and informative for another, depending on how they learned the meanings.
One knows the meanings of expressions descriptively—different descriptions can pick out the same meaning.
What an utterance tells you depends both on what it means and on how you came to know what it means.
"The universe is a perfect unity" isn't meaningless because unconfirmable—it's meaningless because "perfect unity" is undefined.
A sentence is meaningful if it attributes some property to some object.
Any non-compound sentence either attributes a property to an individual or affirms a relation between individuals.
Relational sentences can be reformulated as property-attributions to ordered pairs.
Compound sentences can be reformulated as property-attributions.
Quantified generalizations say how many members one class has in common with another.
The picture theory of meaning is trivially true if it means sentences represent facts, and false if it means they are pictures.
The relationship between sentences and facts has a conventional component; pictures represent non-conventionally.
Sentences go through propositions to facts; pictures go directly to facts.
Sentences are digital structures with unique decomposition into discrete parts; pictures are not.
A photograph functioning as a sentence in a language doesn't function as a picture.
Any conventional assignment of meaning to symbols yields symbols with unique decomposition into discrete parts.
No language can state all of its own semantic rules.
The picture theory is consistent with empiricism because perception gives us pictures.
Much of what we know cannot be embodied in images—negative facts, for instance.
The rules converting perceptual information into propositional knowledge cannot themselves be learned perceptually.
Wittgenstein's claim that we cannot state the logical forms of sentences collapses into the false claim that we can never say what words mean.
"What can be shown cannot be said" is obviously false—I can both show and tell you I can do fifty push-ups.
The liar paradox doesn't show that semantic rules can't be stated—many semantic rules can be stated without self-reference.
Some semantic rules cannot be put into words, but not for the reasons Wittgenstein gives.
Not all entailment is formal entailment—"Brown is a circle" entails "Brown is two-dimensional" but not formally.
"Circle" is not synonymous with its definition, which is why the definition is informative.
There are non-tautologous, non-empirical truths—logical positivism is therefore false.
The concept of a logically perfect language is incoherent.
A sentence is perspicuous iff its logical and grammatical forms coincide.
For each analytic truth a logically perfect language could express, there are infinitely many it couldn't.
Formally true sentences are instances of informally true universal generalizations.
No sentence capable of expressing such generalizations is logically perfect.
Knowledge of a formal entailment requires prior knowledge of an informal entailment.
There are infinitely many informally valid inferences for each formally valid one.
Hempel showed that strict empiricism is incompatible with modern physics.
If magnitudes can have irrational values, there's no strictly observational way to establish this.
Modern physics requires assuming magnitudes can take irrational values.
Strict empiricism is therefore incompatible with the obvious fact that modern physics is knowledge.
The parallel postulate is a statement-form, not a statement—"line" and "space" function as variables.
Different interpretations of geometric primitives yield different geometries.
What we thought were statements sometimes turn out to be statement-forms.
Arithmetical truth cannot be formalized—any formal characterization is incomplete or inconsistent.
Russell's argument against naive realism is flawed—observing effects of objects is not the same as observing effects upon ourselves.
The coldness physics studies is identical with the coldness we feel—physics tells us what that coldness is.
Scientific breakthroughs have both factual components (new data) and conceptual components (new models of old data).
Counterfactual statements are not about other possible worlds but are grammatical variants of causal or logical statements.
We don't know anything about other universes; any knowledge of them would be parasitic on knowledge of counterfactual truths.
