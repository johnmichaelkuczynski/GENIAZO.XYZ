KANT POSITIONS AND QUESTIONS

# 200 Kantian Philosophical Positions

## I. EPISTEMOLOGY

1. All knowledge begins with experience, but not all knowledge arises from experience.

2. Knowledge requires the synthesis of sensory intuitions with conceptual categories supplied by the understanding.

3. The mind is not a passive recipient of impressions but actively structures experience according to its own forms.

4. Objective knowledge is possible only because the mind imposes necessary conditions on all possible experience.

5. Knowledge has two stems: sensibility (which provides intuitions) and understanding (which provides concepts).

6. Neither intuitions without concepts nor concepts without intuitions can yield knowledge.

7. The proper object of human knowledge is appearances (phenomena), not things as they are in themselves.

8. Certainty in knowledge comes not from correspondence with external reality but from the necessary structures of cognition itself.

---

## II. A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE

9. A priori knowledge is knowledge that is independent of all experience and necessarily universal.

10. The marks of a priori knowledge are strict necessity and unrestricted universality.

11. Pure a priori knowledge contains no empirical admixture whatsoever.

12. Mathematics provides paradigmatic examples of pure a priori knowledge.

13. The principles of pure understanding (e.g., causality) are known a priori.

14. A priori knowledge is possible because the mind supplies the forms under which all experience must be organized.

15. The a priori is not innate in the sense of being temporally prior to experience, but is logically independent of experience.

16. A priori truths cannot be refuted by experience because they are conditions for the possibility of experience itself.

17. Space and time, as forms of intuition, are known a priori.

---

## III. A POSTERIORI KNOWLEDGE

18. A posteriori knowledge is knowledge that can only be established through experience.

19. A posteriori judgments are contingent—their negations are logically possible.

20. Empirical knowledge is always particular and can never achieve strict universality.

21. Natural science contains a posteriori elements insofar as it describes particular regularities in nature.

22. The content of perception is given a posteriori, though its form is a priori.

23. A posteriori knowledge depends on the actual course of experience and could have been otherwise.

24. Inductive generalizations, being a posteriori, can never achieve apodictic certainty.

25. The specific laws of nature are known a posteriori, though the general principle that nature has laws is known a priori.

---

## IV. ANALYTIC TRUTH/KNOWLEDGE

26. In analytic judgments, the predicate concept is contained within the subject concept.

27. Analytic judgments are explicative—they clarify but do not extend knowledge.

28. The principle of contradiction is the supreme principle of all analytic judgments.

29. Analytic judgments are knowable a priori because their truth depends solely on the meanings of their terms.

30. "All bachelors are unmarried" is analytic because unmarried is part of the concept of bachelor.

31. Analytic truths cannot be denied without self-contradiction.

32. Analytic judgments, though certain, are cognitively empty—they tell us nothing about the world.

33. The negation of an analytic truth is self-contradictory and therefore necessarily false.

---

## V. SYNTHETIC TRUTH/KNOWLEDGE

34. In synthetic judgments, the predicate concept lies outside the subject concept.

35. Synthetic judgments are ampliative—they genuinely extend our knowledge.

36. Synthetic a posteriori judgments are justified by experience.

37. The revolutionary question of the Critique is: How are synthetic a priori judgments possible?

38. Mathematical truths are synthetic because the predicate is not logically contained in the subject.

39. "7 + 5 = 12" is synthetic because the concept of 12 is not contained in the concepts of 7, 5, and addition.

40. The principles of pure natural science (e.g., every event has a cause) are synthetic a priori.

41. Synthetic a priori judgments are possible because they express the necessary conditions for any possible experience.

42. Metaphysics, if it is to be a science, must consist of synthetic a priori judgments.

---

## VI. TRANSCENDENTAL ARGUMENTS

43. A transcendental argument demonstrates the necessary conditions for the possibility of experience or knowledge.

44. Transcendental arguments proceed regressively from an undeniable fact to its necessary presuppositions.

45. The validity of the categories is established by showing that without them unified experience would be impossible.

46. Transcendental arguments do not prove that things are a certain way, but that we must think them as being that way.

47. The transcendental deduction shows that the categories have objective validity for all possible experience.

48. Transcendental arguments establish truths that are neither merely logical nor merely empirical.

49. The argument for the synthetic unity of apperception is paradigmatically transcendental.

50. Transcendental proofs cannot be dogmatic demonstrations but must show the indispensability of certain concepts.

---

## VII. TRANSCENDENTAL CONDITIONS OF KNOWLEDGE

51. Space and time are the a priori forms of sensible intuition—conditions under which objects can be given to us.

52. The categories of the understanding are conditions under which objects can be thought.

53. The transcendental unity of apperception is the supreme condition of all knowledge.

54. The "I think" must be able to accompany all my representations.

55. The schematism mediates between pure concepts and sensible intuitions.

56. Transcendental imagination synthesizes the manifold of intuition according to the categories.

57. Without the threefold synthesis (apprehension, reproduction, recognition), no coherent experience is possible.

58. The principles of pure understanding (Axioms of Intuition, Anticipations of Perception, Analogies of Experience, Postulates of Empirical Thought) are constitutive of experience.

59. Causality is a transcendental condition—every event must have a cause, not as a fact about the world, but as a condition for experiencing any event at all.

---

## VIII. THE SELF

60. The empirical self is the self as it appears in inner sense—a temporal sequence of mental states.

61. The transcendental self (transcendental ego) is the logical subject of all representations, not itself an object of knowledge.

62. The "I think" is a purely formal unity, not a substantial soul.

63. Rational psychology commits a paralogism by treating the transcendental subject as a knowable substance.

64. We cannot have theoretical knowledge of the soul's immortality, simplicity, or substantiality.

65. The self that appears in inner sense is phenomenal, subject to the form of time.

66. Personal identity is not given by a persisting substance but by the synthetic unity of apperception.

67. The noumenal self (if there is one) would be outside time and thus free from natural causation.

68. Self-knowledge is limited to how we appear to ourselves, not how we are in ourselves.

69. The thinking subject cannot cognize itself as it is in itself, only as it appears.

---

## IX. NOUMENA VS. PHENOMENA

70. Phenomena are objects as they appear to us, conditioned by the forms of intuition and categories of understanding.

71. Noumena are things as they are in themselves, independent of our cognitive apparatus.

72. We can have no positive knowledge of noumena; the concept serves as a limiting concept.

73. The noumenal/phenomenal distinction prevents us from confusing appearances with things in themselves.

74. To say something is a phenomenon is not to say it is an illusion—phenomena are empirically real.

75. Noumena in the negative sense are simply things considered apart from our mode of intuiting them.

76. The positive concept of noumena (objects of intellectual intuition) is problematic for us, since we lack such intuition.

77. The distinction between noumena and phenomena is transcendental, not empirical.

78. Empirical realism (phenomena are real) is compatible with transcendental idealism (phenomena are mind-dependent).

79. The errors of traditional metaphysics arise from treating phenomenal predicates as applicable to noumena.

---

## X. KANT'S COGNITIVE CATEGORIES

80. The categories are pure concepts of the understanding that apply to objects of possible experience.

81. There are exactly twelve categories, derived from the logical forms of judgment.

82. The categories of Quantity are: Unity, Plurality, Totality.

83. The categories of Quality are: Reality, Negation, Limitation.

84. The categories of Relation are: Inherence/Subsistence (substance), Causality/Dependence, Community (reciprocity).

85. The categories of Modality are: Possibility/Impossibility, Existence/Non-existence, Necessity/Contingency.

86. The categories have no content apart from their application to sensible intuition.

87. Unschematized categories are mere logical forms with no cognitive significance.

88. The schemata translate categories into temporal terms applicable to experience.

89. Substance is schematized as permanence in time; causality as succession according to a rule.

90. The categories are not derived from experience but are presupposed by it.

---

## XI. RELATIONSHIP TO ARISTOTLE'S LOGICAL CATEGORIES

91. Kant's categories are epistemological/transcendental; Aristotle's are ontological/metaphysical.

92. Aristotle's categories classify beings; Kant's categories classify ways of thinking about objects.

93. Aristotle derived his categories unsystematically; Kant derives his from the table of judgments.

94. Aristotle's category of substance refers to independently existing things; Kant's refers to the logical subject of predication and the schema of permanence.

95. Kant criticizes Aristotle for mixing empirical concepts (e.g., motion, place) with pure concepts.

96. Kant's table claims completeness on principled grounds; Aristotle's list is rhapsodic.

97. Aristotle's categories apply to things in themselves; Kant's apply only to phenomena.

98. Both recognize substance and relation as fundamental, but interpret them differently.

99. Kant transforms Aristotelian metaphysics into critical epistemology.

---

## XII. THE LIMITS OF REASON

100. Reason inevitably generates ideas that transcend all possible experience (God, soul, cosmos).

101. The transcendental ideas are regulative, not constitutive—they guide inquiry but do not yield knowledge.

102. The antinomies arise when reason tries to think the unconditioned totality of conditions.

103. Traditional metaphysics fails because it applies categories beyond the bounds of possible experience.

104. Theoretical reason cannot prove or disprove the existence of God, freedom, or immortality.

105. The critique of reason is reason's self-examination of its own powers and limits.

106. Speculative metaphysics must be replaced by critical metaphysics—the study of the conditions of knowledge.

107. Reason's illusions are natural and unavoidable but must be recognized as illusions.

108. The proper use of transcendental ideas is regulative: to seek ever greater unity and completeness in knowledge.

109. Attempting to know noumena produces only dialectical illusion, not genuine cognition.

---

## XIII. THE NATURE OF GOD

110. God is conceived as the ens realissimum—the being possessing all perfections.

111. God is the transcendental ideal—the concept of a being that grounds all possibility.

112. Theoretical reason cannot determine whether God exists or what God's nature is.

113. The ontological argument fails because existence is not a real predicate.

114. The cosmological argument illicitly infers from contingent existence to a necessary being.

115. The physico-theological (design) argument at most proves an architect, not a creator ex nihilo.

116. All proofs of God's existence ultimately rest on the invalid ontological argument.

117. God, as a noumenon, cannot be an object of theoretical cognition.

118. The concept of God is practically necessary as the postulate of moral reason.

---

## XIV. GOD AS NOUMENON

119. If God exists, God exists as a thing in itself, not as an appearance in space and time.

120. We cannot apply the categories to God because they function only in relation to sensible intuition.

121. Statements about God's attributes are analogical, not literal—we use concepts from experience symbolically.

122. God is not subject to temporal succession or spatial location.

123. God's causality (if any) would be noumenal, not phenomenal—not subject to natural laws.

124. The noumenal status of God means theoretical agnosticism: we cannot know, only think, God.

125. God as noumenon is compatible with the thoroughgoing causal determinism of the phenomenal world.

---

## XV. GOD AS NOUMENAL SUBSTRATE OF THE UNIVERSE

126. The transcendental ideal represents God as the ground of all possibility—that from which all determinations derive.

127. God, conceived as the ens realissimum, is the substrate from which all finite realities are limitations.

128. This conception is regulative: we are to think of the world as if grounded in a supreme reality.

129. The intelligible (noumenal) ground of appearances might be conceived as divine.

130. Speculative theology cannot establish that there is such a substrate, only that reason naturally forms this idea.

131. The concept of God as noumenal ground helps unify our conception of nature under one principle.

---

## XVI. GOD AS CONSTITUTING (VS. CREATING) THE UNIVERSE

132. Creation ex nihilo is a temporal concept inapplicable to a noumenal God.

133. If God grounds the world, it is not through a temporal act but through a timeless ontological relation.

134. The noumenal substrate constitutes appearances in the sense of grounding their possibility, not manufacturing them.

135. God as constituting ground differs from a deistic creator who initiates a causal series.

136. The relationship between noumenal ground and phenomenal world is not itself a causal relationship in the empirical sense.

137. Traditional theological language of "creation" must be understood analogically or symbolically.

---

## XVII. RELIGION

138. Religion within the limits of reason alone focuses on morality, not revelation or miracle.

139. The moral law is the authentic core of religious teaching.

140. Historical religions are vehicles for moral truths accessible to reason.

141. Rational religion requires no church, ritual, or clergy—only the moral disposition.

142. The idea of a moral community (ethical commonwealth) is the true church.

143. Statutory religions are legitimate only insofar as they promote morality.

144. Religious doctrines must be interpreted to accord with moral reason.

145. Miracles, if they occur, add nothing to our moral duties.

---

## XVIII. RATIONAL VS. DOGMATIC RELIGION

146. Dogmatic religion accepts doctrines on authority without rational justification.

147. Rational religion accepts only what can be established by moral reason.

148. Dogmatic religion subordinates morality to theological commands; rational religion subordinates theology to morality.

149. True religion is moral religion—recognition of duties as divine commands.

150. Dogmatic religion emphasizes grace, revelation, and cult; rational religion emphasizes virtue and moral effort.

151. Ecclesiastical faith (statutory religion) should gradually give way to pure rational faith.

152. Religious disputes arise from confusing the vehicle (historical religion) with the essence (moral law).

153. Rational religion is universal; dogmatic religions are parochial.

---

## XIX. ETHICS

154. Morality is grounded in reason alone, not in empirical desires, sentiments, or consequences.

155. The moral law is categorical—it commands unconditionally, regardless of inclinations.

156. Only a good will is unconditionally good; all other goods are conditional.

157. The good will is good not because of what it accomplishes but because of its principle of volition.

158. Duty is the necessity of acting from respect for the moral law.

159. Actions have moral worth only when done from duty, not merely in conformity with duty.

160. Moral principles must be universal and necessary, not derived from particular circumstances.

161. Happiness is not the ground of morality but may be its consequence under a moral world order.

---

## XX. RATIONAL BASIS OF ETHICS

162. The categorical imperative is the supreme principle of morality, derivable from reason alone.

163. The first formulation: Act only according to that maxim you can will to be a universal law.

164. The second formulation (humanity formula): Treat humanity, in yourself and others, always as an end, never merely as a means.

165. The third formulation (autonomy formula): Act as a legislating member of a kingdom of ends.

166. All formulations express the same fundamental principle from different perspectives.

167. Moral autonomy is the capacity of rational beings to give themselves the moral law.

168. Heteronomous ethics (grounded in desire, happiness, divine command) cannot yield genuinely binding obligations.

169. Practical reason is self-legislating—it does not receive the law from outside but enacts it.

170. The moral law is a synthetic a priori practical principle.

---

## XXI. NATURE OF MORAL OBLIGATION

171. Moral obligation is necessitation of an imperfectly rational will by the moral law.

172. For a perfectly rational being, morality would not take the form of obligation or imperative.

173. Human beings experience the moral law as constraint because they have sensuous inclinations.

174. Obligation implies freedom: ought implies can.

175. Moral obligation is unconditional—not hypothetical upon any desired end.

176. The feeling of respect is the subjective effect of the moral law on sensibility.

177. Moral obligation binds all rational beings as such, not merely humans.

178. The bindingness of duty is not contingent on reward or punishment.

---

## XXII. PERMISSIBLE SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT

179. The only legitimate form of government is republican—based on freedom, equality, and the rule of law.

180. Political authority must be exercised according to publicly promulgated laws.

181. Citizens must have equal rights under the law regardless of birth or status.

182. Freedom requires that no one can be coerced except according to universal law.

183. The social contract is not historical but an idea of reason legitimizing the state.

184. Despotism conflates legislative and executive power; republicanism separates them.

185. There is no right to revolution, though illegitimate governments should be reformed.

186. International relations should be governed by a federation of free states aiming at perpetual peace.

---

## XXIII. PERMISSIBLE ECONOMIC SYSTEMS

187. Property rights are grounded in the rational will and must be secured by civil law.

188. Original acquisition of property must be compatible with the freedom of all others.

189. The state must enforce contracts and protect property as conditions of external freedom.

190. Economic relations must respect persons as ends in themselves, not exploit them as mere means.

191. A just economic order allows all citizens the conditions for exercising their freedom.

192. Extreme inequality that denies some persons the means of independence is morally suspect.

---

## XXIV. KANT-LAPLACE HYPOTHESIS

193. The solar system originated from a rotating nebula that gradually condensed under gravitational attraction.

194. The initial nebula was a diffuse cloud of gas and dust distributed uniformly through space.

195. Gravitational collapse caused rotation to accelerate and the nebula to flatten into a disk.

196. Planets formed from the accretion of matter in rings separated from the central mass.

197. This hypothesis explains the coplanar orbits and uniform rotational direction of planets.

198. The same natural laws that govern the cosmos now sufficed to produce it from initial chaos.

199. No supernatural intervention is required to explain the structure of the solar system.

---

## XXV. IDEALITY OF SPACE

200. Space is not a property of things in themselves but the form of outer intuition.

201. Space is empirically real—it applies to all objects of outer experience.

202. Space is transcendentally ideal—it does not pertain to things apart from our mode of intuition.

203. Space is a pure a priori intuition, not a general concept abstracted from experience.

204. We can represent empty space but cannot represent the absence of space.

205. The singularity and infinity of space prove it is an intuition, not a concept.

206. Geometry is possible as synthetic a priori knowledge because space is a pure form of intuition.

207. Space is not a substance, a relation among substances, or an absolute container.

208. The ideality of space means that spatial properties do not characterize things in themselves.

---

## XXVI. IDEALITY OF TIME

209. Time is the form of inner sense—the form under which we intuit ourselves and our mental states.

210. Time is also mediately the form of all appearances, since all representations occur in time.

211. Time is empirically real for all appearances but transcendentally ideal.

212. Time is not an independent reality but a subjective condition of intuition.

213. Simultaneity and succession are temporal relations that hold only for phenomena.

214. The unity of time grounds the possibility of representing objects as enduring or changing.

215. Time, like space, is a pure a priori intuition, presupposed by all empirical representations.

216. Arithmetic is grounded in the successive synthesis of units in time.

217. Things in themselves are not in time; temporal predicates apply only to appearances.

---

## XXVII. NATURE OF MATHEMATICAL TRUTH/KNOWLEDGE

218. Mathematical propositions are synthetic a priori—they extend knowledge and are necessarily true.

219. Geometry is grounded in the pure intuition of space and applies necessarily to spatial objects.

220. Arithmetic depends on the successive synthesis of units in time—it is not merely analytic.

221. Mathematical certainty derives from the construction of concepts in pure intuition.

222. Mathematical truths are not discovered by analyzing concepts but by constructing objects in intuition.

223. The apodictic certainty of mathematics is explained by its grounding in pure intuition.

224. Applied mathematics describes the phenomenal world because phenomena must conform to space and time.

225. Mathematics is not about things in themselves but about the formal structure of possible experience.

226. The universality of mathematical truths reflects the universality of the forms of intuition.

227. Mathematical reasoning is synthetic because it proceeds by construction, not mere conceptual analysis.

# 200 Additional Kantian Philosophical Positions (Part II)

## I. EPISTEMOLOGY

1. The Copernican revolution in philosophy holds that objects must conform to our cognition, not cognition to objects.

2. Transcendental philosophy investigates not objects but our mode of cognizing objects insofar as this is possible a priori.

3. The synthetic unity of the manifold of intuition is the ground of the identity of apperception itself.

4. Cognition involves both receptivity (sensibility) and spontaneity (understanding).

5. The understanding cannot intuit, and the senses cannot think; only through their union does knowledge arise.

6. Experience is itself a species of knowledge that involves understanding, whose rule I must presuppose in myself before objects are given to me.

7. The original synthetic unity of apperception is objective because it is the condition of all knowledge of objects.

8. All empirical consciousness has a necessary relation to a transcendental consciousness preceding all particular experience.

9. The thoroughgoing affinity of appearances is a necessary consequence of the synthesis according to concepts.

10. Cognition and its object must agree; an object is that in the concept of which the manifold of a given intuition is united.

---

## II. A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE

11. Pure reason contains the principles for knowing something absolutely a priori.

12. The a priori origin of principles can be established by showing that without them experience itself would be impossible.

13. A priori cognitions are those with which no empirical element is intermixed.

14. The possibility of experience is itself the a priori ground of the objective validity of the categories.

15. We can know a priori of things only what we ourselves put into them.

16. The synthetic a priori is not mysterious once we recognize that the mind legislates to nature.

17. A priori principles are not rules abstracted from experience but rules that make experience possible.

18. The understanding is the source of the laws of nature with respect to their formal structure.

19. Pure intuitions and pure concepts are the a priori elements of all human cognition.

20. A priori knowledge is distinguished not by its temporal origin but by its independence from any particular experience.

---

## III. A POSTERIORI KNOWLEDGE

21. Perception is empirical consciousness—consciousness accompanied by sensation.

22. The matter of appearance—that which corresponds to sensation—is given a posteriori.

23. Empirical intuition is possible only through pure intuition of space and time.

24. A posteriori judgments require the testimony of experience for their justification.

25. The particular laws of nature cannot be derived from the categories alone; they must be learned empirically.

26. Experience teaches us that something is constituted thus and so, but not that it could not be otherwise.

27. Sensation is the effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, insofar as we are affected by it.

28. All our intuition is nothing but the representation of appearance; the things we intuit are not in themselves what we intuit them as being.

29. The real in appearances (corresponding to sensation) always has an intensive magnitude or degree.

---

## IV. ANALYTIC TRUTH/KNOWLEDGE

30. In analytic judgments, the connection of subject and predicate is thought through identity.

31. Analytic judgments rest entirely on the principle of contradiction.

32. All analytic judgments are a priori, even when their concepts are empirical (e.g., "Gold is a yellow metal").

33. Analytic judgments require no appeal to experience for their justification, only reflection on concepts.

34. The predicate of an affirmative analytic judgment is covertly contained in the subject concept.

35. Analytic judgments clarify but do not amplify our cognition.

36. Logical analysis of concepts yields only analytic truths.

37. The truth of an analytic judgment is guaranteed by the law of non-contradiction alone.

38. Analytic judgments are epistemically trivial but logically necessary.

---

## V. SYNTHETIC TRUTH/KNOWLEDGE

39. Synthetic judgments require a third thing beyond subject and predicate to mediate their connection.

40. In synthetic a posteriori judgments, experience provides the mediating third term.

41. In synthetic a priori judgments, pure intuition provides the mediating third term.

42. The principle that every event has a cause is synthetic because causation is not contained in the concept of event.

43. Synthetic a priori judgments are the proper subject matter of transcendental philosophy.

44. The possibility of synthetic a priori judgments is the general problem of pure reason.

45. All judgments of experience are synthetic because they go beyond what the concept of the subject contains.

46. The ampliative character of synthetic judgments makes them indispensable for genuine knowledge.

47. Synthetic unity differs from analytic unity as combination differs from mere analysis.

48. The synthesis of apprehension, reproduction, and recognition grounds all synthetic cognition.

---

## VI. TRANSCENDENTAL ARGUMENTS

49. Transcendental proofs must show that something is a condition of the possibility of experience as such.

50. The transcendental deduction answers the quid juris: by what right do we apply pure concepts to objects?

51. A transcendental argument is not a causal explanation but a demonstration of necessary presuppositions.

52. The objectivity of the categories is secured by showing they are conditions of any unified consciousness.

53. Transcendental arguments establish the validity of concepts for possible experience, not for things in themselves.

54. The unity of consciousness requires that the manifold of intuition be subject to the categories.

55. Transcendental arguments reveal that certain skeptical positions are self-undermining.

56. The refutation of idealism is a transcendental argument: inner experience presupposes outer experience.

57. Transcendental reasoning shows that denying certain principles makes coherent experience impossible.

---

## VII. TRANSCENDENTAL CONDITIONS OF KNOWLEDGE

58. The understanding itself is the lawgiver of nature—not of empirical laws, but of the universal form of law.

59. Nature, as the sum of appearances, is possible only in the unity of apperception.

60. The objective unity of self-consciousness is the condition of all knowledge of objects.

61. Synthesis is the act of putting different representations together and comprehending their manifoldness in one cognition.

62. The categories are functions of unity in judgment applied to the synthesis of intuitions.

63. The transcendental schema of substance is permanence of the real in time.

64. The schema of causality is the real upon which, whenever posited, something else always follows.

65. The schema of community is the coexistence of determinations of one substance with those of another according to a universal rule.

66. The schema of possibility is the agreement of the synthesis of representations with the conditions of time in general.

67. The schema of actuality is existence at a determinate time.

68. The schema of necessity is the existence of an object at all times.

---

## VIII. THE SELF

69. The I is simple in representation, but this does not establish that the soul is a simple substance.

70. The transcendental subject is the logical correlate of all concepts, not an intuitable object.

71. Inner sense gives us ourselves only as we appear, not as we are in ourselves.

72. The unity of consciousness does not reveal the nature of the thinking being.

73. From the bare I think nothing can be inferred about the substantiality, simplicity, or permanence of the soul.

74. The identity of the subject of which I am conscious in all my representations is not the identity of substance.

75. The soul, as object of inner sense, is phenomenal; what it is in itself is unknowable.

76. Rational psychology's errors arise from treating the transcendental unity of apperception as an object of cognition.

77. Self-affection means that we intuit ourselves only through the way we are affected internally.

78. The I think expresses an indeterminate empirical intuition, not a determinate cognition of a noumenal self.

---

## IX. NOUMENA VS. PHENOMENA

79. The concept of a noumenon is a boundary concept—it limits sensibility without positing anything beyond it.

80. Phenomena are not mere illusions; they are empirically real objects given under the forms of intuition.

81. Transcendental idealism maintains that space and time are not properties of things in themselves.

82. Empirical realism affirms that external objects are real as phenomena within space.

83. The thing in itself is not a different thing from the appearance but the same thing considered differently.

84. We know phenomena as they appear but not what they are in themselves.

85. Noumena cannot be positively characterized because all our determinate concepts are schematized for sensibility.

86. The distinction between phenomena and noumena saves both science and morality.

87. The phenomenal world is deterministic; the noumenal realm allows room for freedom.

88. To confuse phenomena with things in themselves is the source of transcendental illusion.

---

## X. KANT'S COGNITIVE CATEGORIES

89. The categories are pure concepts originating solely in the understanding.

90. Without application to intuition, categories are merely logical functions without content.

91. The categories can be derived systematically from the logical forms of judgment.

92. Each category corresponds to a specific form of synthesis through which the manifold is united.

93. Categories of quantity determine the extensive magnitude of intuitions.

94. Categories of quality determine the intensive magnitude (degree) of sensations.

95. Categories of relation determine the connection of perceptions in one consciousness.

96. Categories of modality do not add to the concept of an object but express its relation to cognition.

97. Mathematical categories (quantity, quality) are constitutive of intuitions.

98. Dynamical categories (relation, modality) are constitutive of the existence of objects in relation to each other.

99. Each category has a corresponding schema that temporalizes the pure concept for application to experience.

---

## XI. RELATIONSHIP TO ARISTOTLE'S LOGICAL CATEGORIES

100. Kant transforms Aristotle's categories from descriptive classifications to transcendental conditions.

101. Aristotle lists ten categories without a principle of completeness; Kant claims systematic derivation.

102. Aristotle's categories describe what is; Kant's describe how we must think what is.

103. Kant rejects Aristotle's inclusion of time, place, position, and state as mixing pure and empirical concepts.

104. The Kantian category of relation encompasses what Aristotle distributed among several categories.

105. For Aristotle, substance is primary being; for Kant, substance is the schema of permanence underlying change.

106. Kant regards Aristotle's categories as lacking unity of principle and merely empirically assembled.

107. The critical transformation of the categories removes them from metaphysics to epistemology.

108. Both Kant and Aristotle agree that substance and attribute are fundamental, though they interpret them differently.

---

## XII. THE LIMITS OF REASON

109. The ideas of reason (soul, world, God) have no corresponding object in possible experience.

110. The cosmological antinomies arise from treating the world as a thing in itself with determinate totality.

111. The thesis of each antinomy represents rationalist dogmatism; the antithesis represents empiricist dogmatism.

112. In mathematical antinomies, both thesis and antithesis are false because they presuppose a completed infinite series.

113. In dynamical antinomies, both thesis and antithesis can be true because they apply to different realms (noumena and phenomena).

114. Transcendental illusion is natural and unavoidable—reason necessarily generates it.

115. The ideas of reason have legitimate regulative use in guiding the understanding toward systematic unity.

116. To mistake regulative principles for constitutive principles is to fall into dogmatic metaphysics.

117. The dialectic of pure reason reveals that unaided speculation cannot resolve ultimate questions.

118. The proper business of reason is not to extend knowledge beyond experience but to secure it within experience.

---

## XIII. THE NATURE OF GOD

119. The concept of God as ens realissimum represents the sum total of all predicates of things in general.

120. The transcendental ideal hypostasizes this concept into an individual being.

121. The three speculative proofs of God (ontological, cosmological, physico-theological) all fail.

122. The ontological argument confuses logical with real predicates.

123. One hundred actual dollars contain not a penny more than one hundred possible dollars.

124. The cosmological argument covertly employs the ontological argument by moving from necessary being to most real being.

125. The argument from design cannot establish an infinite, necessary, omnipotent creator.

126. Theoretical reason can neither prove nor disprove God's existence.

127. The concept of God remains a legitimate idea of reason though not an object of knowledge.

---

## XIV. GOD AS NOUMENON

128. God, if existing, would not be subject to the conditions of time and space.

129. We cannot know whether there is a being corresponding to the concept of God.

130. All predicates we apply to God are derived from experience and applied only analogically.

131. Divine omniscience, omnipotence, and benevolence cannot be theoretically demonstrated.

132. God's existence as noumenon is compatible with the determinism of phenomena.

133. A noumenal God would be causa noumenon—a cause not subject to empirical causation.

134. We must think God under categories, but this does not yield knowledge of God.

135. The noumenal character of God means rational theology yields only faith, not science.

---

## XV. GOD AS NOUMENAL SUBSTRATE OF THE UNIVERSE

136. The ideal of pure reason represents the idea of a ground of thoroughgoing determination.

137. All finite things are determinations or limitations of the one unlimited reality.

138. This conception does not prove a supreme being exists but shows how reason naturally forms the idea.

139. The ens realissimum grounds all possibility by containing all predicates primitively.

140. Negative predicates (non-being, limitation) presuppose positive predicates in the unlimited being.

141. The world of appearances might be grounded in an intelligible substrate inaccessible to theoretical cognition.

142. Reason seeks the unconditioned ground of all conditioned existence, though it cannot know this ground.

---

## XVI. GOD AS CONSTITUTING (VS. CREATING) THE UNIVERSE

143. Noumenal causality is not successive—it does not operate in time as phenomenal causation does.

144. If God grounds the phenomenal world, this grounding is ontological, not temporal.

145. The concept of creation in time cannot apply to a timeless noumenal ground.

146. The distinction between phenomenal succession and noumenal grounding prevents anthropomorphic theology.

147. God as constituting ground differs from the watchmaker God of deistic natural theology.

148. The noumenal ground of appearances is not a first member of a temporal series.

---

## XVII. RELIGION

149. The moral law within us is the authentic voice of the divine.

150. Ecclesiastical faith requires interpretation through pure moral religion.

151. Prayer, ritual, and observance have value only as means to moral improvement.

152. Religion is the recognition of all our duties as divine commands.

153. Radical evil is the innate propensity to subordinate moral law to self-love.

154. Moral regeneration requires a revolution in disposition, a rebirth of character.

155. The historical person of a moral teacher is less important than the moral archetype he represents.

156. The ethical community is the kingdom of God on earth—a union of persons under moral laws.

157. Clericalism that substitutes observance for morality is pseudo-service to God.

---

## XVIII. RATIONAL VS. DOGMATIC RELIGION

158. Rational religion derives its content from moral reason; dogmatic religion accepts revelation uncritically.

159. The Bible should be read as a vehicle for moral truth, not as literal metaphysical doctrine.

160. Miracles cannot add to moral duty, which is already completely determined by reason.

161. Dogmatic religion makes salvation depend on belief; rational religion makes it depend on moral disposition.

162. Rational religion is available to all rational beings as such; dogmatic religion is historically particular.

163. The gradual progress of humanity is toward pure rational faith.

164. Mysteries and sacraments must be interpreted morally or set aside.

165. Dogmatic religion risks superstition; rational religion upholds human autonomy and dignity.

---

## XIX. ETHICS

166. The moral law commands categorically, not hypothetically.

167. Hypothetical imperatives are conditional on some end; categorical imperatives are unconditional.

168. All imperatives express an ought—the relation of objective laws of reason to a will not necessarily determined by them.

169. A perfectly good will would act according to the moral law without experiencing it as imperative.

170. The good will is the only unconditional good because all other goods can be misused.

171. Talents, gifts, and fortune are good only when governed by a good will.

172. Acting in conformity with duty is not the same as acting from duty.

173. The shopkeeper who gives correct change from self-interest acts in conformity with duty but not from duty.

174. Moral worth attaches only to actions done from respect for the moral law.

175. Inclination, even benevolent inclination, has no moral worth unless it is subordinated to duty.

---

## XX. RATIONAL BASIS OF ETHICS

176. The universalizability test determines whether a maxim is morally permissible.

177. A maxim that cannot be universalized without contradiction is forbidden.

178. Making a lying promise fails the universalizability test because universal lying would destroy the institution of promising.

179. Suicide from self-love is contradictory because the same principle (self-love) would mandate both living and dying.

180. Neglecting to develop talents is wrong because we cannot rationally will a world of universal idleness.

181. Refusing to aid others in distress is wrong because we cannot will a world in which no one helps anyone.

182. The humanity formula prohibits using persons merely as instruments.

183. The dignity of rational beings places them above all price.

184. Autonomy is the ground of the dignity of human and every rational nature.

185. Heteronomy arises when the will seeks its law in any object outside itself.

---

## XXI. NATURE OF MORAL OBLIGATION

186. Moral necessitation arises because finite rational beings have inclinations that may conflict with reason.

187. Obligation presupposes the possibility of acting otherwise—duty implies freedom.

188. The binding force of the moral law does not derive from consequences or feelings.

189. Respect for the moral law is a unique feeling produced by reason, not derived from sensibility.

190. Duty is not a burden imposed from without but the expression of our rational nature.

191. The moral law is legislative for all rational beings, not merely human beings.

192. Perfect duties admit no exception in favor of inclination; imperfect duties allow latitude in fulfillment.

193. The supreme principle of morality is the form of universal law commanded by reason.

---

## XXII. PERMISSIBLE SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT

194. Civil society exists to secure the external freedom of each compatible with the freedom of all.

195. The original contract is an idea of reason that legitimizes positive law.

196. Laws must be such that they could have been consented to by all rational citizens.

197. The sovereign represents the general united will, not private interests.

198. Active citizenship requires economic independence; those dependent on others cannot vote.

199. Punishment is justified solely by desert, not by deterrence or rehabilitation.

200. The federation of free states would replace the lawless condition among nations with lawful relations.

201. Perpetual peace is the final goal of all international right.

202. A world republic may be ideal but a league of states is more practically attainable.

---

## XXIII. PERMISSIBLE ECONOMIC SYSTEMS

203. The right to property is an external mine and thine established by civil law.

204. Unilateral acquisition requires subsequent juridical validation by the civil condition.

205. The state may regulate property for the common good while respecting acquired rights.

206. A just state provides the juridical framework for economic activity but does not direct it.

207. Contracts must be honored—pacta sunt servanda is a principle of right.

208. Servitude and slavery violate the innate right to freedom and are absolutely impermissible.

209. Each person has the right to seek economic independence through labor and exchange.

210. The civil condition transforms provisional natural rights into secured peremptory rights.

---

## XXIV. KANT-LAPLACE HYPOTHESIS

211. The nebular hypothesis exemplifies the power of mechanical explanation in cosmology.

212. Kant proposed in 1755 that the universe developed from a primordial chaos by natural laws.

213. Rotation and gravitational attraction explain the formation of the solar system without supernatural intervention.

214. The disk shape of the Milky Way reflects its origin from a rotating nebula.

215. Other nebulae are island universes—galaxies comparable to our own Milky Way.

216. The laws of Newtonian mechanics suffice to account for cosmic evolution.

217. Teleological order in nature need not imply an external designer—it can arise from mechanical principles.

218. The hypothesis illustrates that natural science explains phenomena without appealing to transcendent causes.

---

## XXV. IDEALITY OF SPACE

219. Space is nothing other than the form of all appearances of outer sense.

220. Space is represented as a given infinite magnitude—this marks it as intuition, not concept.

221. Geometry constructs its objects in pure spatial intuition a priori.

222. The apodicticity of geometry derives from the a priori status of space.

223. If space were a thing in itself, geometry would be empirical and contingent.

224. Leibniz erred in treating space as a confused representation of relations among things in themselves.

225. Newton erred in treating space as an absolute container existing independently of things.

226. The ideality of space dissolves the conflict between Leibnizian and Newtonian views.

227. Spatial properties (shape, size, position) pertain to phenomena only, not to things in themselves.

228. The pure intuition of space is the source of all geometrical constructions.

---

## XXVI. IDEALITY OF TIME

229. Time is the form of inner sense—the mode under which the mind intuits its own states.

230. All appearances whatsoever are in time, since all representations are states of the mind.

231. Time is not something that exists in itself or inheres in things as an objective determination.

232. The three modes of time are duration, succession, and coexistence.

233. Time is the formal condition of all appearances in general.

234. Change is possible only in time; without time, neither change nor permanence is representable.

235. The permanence of substance is the schema of time with respect to duration.

236. If time were a thing in itself, it would exist without any actual object.

237. Time has only one dimension; different times are not simultaneous but successive.

238. The infinity of time means that every determinate magnitude of time is possible only through limitations of one underlying time.

---

## XXVII. NATURE OF MATHEMATICAL TRUTH/KNOWLEDGE

239. Mathematical cognition is cognition from the construction of concepts.

240. To construct a concept is to exhibit a priori the intuition corresponding to it.

241. In geometry, construction proceeds in pure spatial intuition.

242. Algebraic construction employs symbolic construction through characters representing magnitudes.

243. Mathematical demonstrations exhibit their objects in intuition and thus yield synthetic knowledge.

244. Philosophy cannot proceed by construction because philosophical concepts cannot be exhibited in pure intuition.

245. The synthetic character of mathematics explains why mathematical discoveries are genuine extensions of knowledge.

246. Mathematical axioms are immediately certain because they are grounded in pure intuition.

247. Mathematical postulates are practical propositions for constructing figures.

248. The necessity of mathematical truths follows from their grounding in the necessary forms of intuition.

249. Mathematics achieves apodictic certainty because it deals with the necessary structure of appearances.

250. The applicability of mathematics to nature is guaranteed because nature must conform to the forms of intuition.
