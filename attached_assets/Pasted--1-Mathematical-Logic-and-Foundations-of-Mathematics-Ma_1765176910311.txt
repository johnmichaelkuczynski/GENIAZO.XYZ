### 1. Mathematical Logic and Foundations of Mathematics
- Mathematics can be reduced entirely to logic through logicism, as all mathematical truths derive from logical axioms and definitions.
- Numbers exist as logical constructs, independent of human thought but discovered through analysis rather than invented.
- Mathematical truths are certain because they are tautologies or logical necessities, unlike empirical claims which are probabilistic and fallible.
- Infinity is coherent as a logical concept, with different sizes (cardinalities) distinguished through set theory, such as countable vs. uncountable infinities.
- Confidence in proofs comes from their deductive structure from self-evident axioms, though consistency is assumed until paradoxes arise.
- Logical necessity and mathematical necessity are identical, as mathematics is a branch of logic.
- Mathematical objects are discovered via logical analysis, not invented.
- Axioms are consistent if no contradictions are derived, though absolute proof is impossible post-Gödel.
- Mathematics applies to the physical world because the world has a logical structure analyzable by reason.
- There is a single correct (classical) logic, though alternatives like intuitionistic logic are unjustified.
- Genuine proofs are formal deductions from axioms, distinct from persuasive rhetoric.
- All mathematics can be formalized using predicate logic and type theory.
- Mathematical existence means logical consistency within a system, not physical reality.
- Definitions in mathematics identify logical equivalents rather than create objects.
- Mathematical knowledge is a priori, possible through acquaintance with logical universals.

### 2. Set Theory and the Theory of Types
- Paradoxes from self-reference are avoided through the ramified theory of types, which hierarchies propositions and prohibits self-membership.
- Hierarchy among abstract objects is natural and necessary to prevent vicious circles.
- No collection can be a member of itself, as per type theory's restrictions.
- A class relates to its members as a logical construct, not a substantial entity.
- Legitimate totalities are those definable without self-reference; spurious ones lead to paradoxes.
- A set differs from a mere collection by being defined via propositional functions.
- The null set exists as a logical construct with no members.
- The axiom of choice is a substantive assumption, not self-evident.
- Predicates define sets only if they satisfy the vicious circle principle.
- Sets too large (like the class of all classes) are improper and handled via types.
- No universal set exists, to avoid paradoxes.
- Intension and extension relate through propositional functions defining classes.
