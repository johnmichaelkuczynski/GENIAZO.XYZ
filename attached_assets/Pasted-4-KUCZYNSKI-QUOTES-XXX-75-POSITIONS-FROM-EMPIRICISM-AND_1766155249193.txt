75 POSITIONS FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY
by John-Michael Kuczynski
============================================================================

CRITIQUE OF EMPIRICISM
----------------------
1. Empiricism forces the external world to appear as nothing more than a collection of mutually disconnected, ex nihilo events, since all there is to it is what observation reveals.
2. To the extent a scientist complies with the empiricist credo that one must "stick to the facts," he cannot embed observable events in otherwise unobservable continuities.
3. The empiricist, forced to hold that events occur spontaneously, is ipso facto incapable of explaining them.
4. If completely described by conscious experience alone, a person's mind would consist of spontaneities flanked by lapses in consciousness that would themselves be spontaneities.
5. Empiricism is inimical to the idea of any invisible structure.
6. The term "empirical thought" is an oxymoron: to the extent that thought mediates between one's observations and one's beliefs, the latter are not directly supported by observation.
7. Most philosophers describe themselves as empiricists; most really are empiricists, making heavy concessions to empiricism even when those concessions lack empiricism-independent justification.
8. Empiricism-based or empiricism-inspired methodologies have damaged psychology.
9. Hume accepted skepticism about sense-perception and induction on the grounds that they were corollaries of empiricism, instead of rejecting empiricism for that reason.
10. Mach's characteristically empiricist position that molecules are but useful fictions was proven wrong by Einstein's work on Brownian motion.

NON-SPATIOTEMPORAL ENTITIES
---------------------------
11. Propositions are non-spatiotemporal entities.
12. Properties are non-spatiotemporal.
13. The spatiotemporal world comprises no instances of any logical relations.
14. Propositions consist of properties.
15. There are five logical relations that may hold between propositions: entailment, confirmation, disconfirmation, incompatibility, and neutrality.
16. The relata of logical relations must be things that are true or false.
17. Properties cannot be identified with spatiotemporal entities whose constituents are that property's instances (scattered objects).
18. Any two uninstantiated properties would be identical if properties were identical with scattered objects—which is obviously false.
19. When a property ceases to be instantiated, it ceases to be instantiated but does not cease to exist.
20. Empiricists deny that propositions exist because propositions, if they exist, are non-spatiotemporal.

PROPOSITIONS AND MEANING
------------------------
21. A proposition is what one affirms when one makes a statement; it is not identical with any sentence.
22. The same proposition can be the meaning of distinct sentences.
23. Propositions consist of concepts.
24. The meaning of a complex expression cannot be directly determined by convention; one must always figure out what is meant.
25. Sentences, not propositions, being the relata of logical relations is an empiricist view that fails.
26. It is really meanings (propositions) that entail one another; expressions entail each other only in a derivative sense.
27. It is only in a doubly derivative sense that one expression entails another.
28. Statements to the effect that a sentence is "formally true" or an argument is "formally valid" are abbreviated ways of making statements about propositions.
29. Empiricists attempt to spatiotemporalize meaning, and these attempts fail as badly as their attempts to spatiotemporalize properties.
30. Wittgenstein's thesis that "meaning is use" cannot be correct, as it would imply linguistic activity could occur on planets with no sentient life.

CONSTITUTIVE VS. CAUSAL DEPENDENCE
----------------------------------
31. To say that x "mediates" y is to say that y's existence constitutively depends on x's—meaning the things composing y are identical with (a subset of) the things composing x.
32. Constitutive dependence differs from causal dependence: a house's existence is constitutively, not causally, dependent on its bricks.
33. One must distinguish the statement that X's parts are governed by laws L from the non-equivalent statement that X itself is governed by those laws.
34. One must distinguish the statement that X complies with the same laws as Y from the non-equivalent statement that X-internal events are to be explained in terms of the same principles as Y-internal events.

PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
-------------------------
35. Everything said about the relationship between physiology and microphysics holds of the relationship between psychology and physiology.
36. Psychology and physiology are even more remote from each other than physiology and microphysics.
37. Every proposition of every discipline other than psychology represents facts as being in a common spatiotemporal coordinate system; psychological propositions categorically do not.
38. Your perception of a collision, though given as occurring in the same temporal manifold as the collision, is not given as occurring in the same spatial manifold.
39. The explanatory generalizations of a given discipline consist of concepts distinct from those composing the explanatory generalizations of other disciplines.
40. No physicalistic statements (concerning the spatiotemporal realm involving no psychological concepts) explain why mentalistic statements are true.

CAUSATION
---------
41. The distinctively empiricist position (Hume's) holds that we see events but do not see forces, therefore we are not entitled to say that anything makes anything happen.
42. This empiricist position on causation holds that statements of the form "given x, y had to happen" are categorically false.
43. Causes do make effects happen; there are genuine causal forces, not merely regularities.
44. Ernest Nagel's The Structure of Science assumes the cogency of Humean causation, which sullies this otherwise magisterial work.

SUBPERSONAL MENTATION
---------------------
45. There is subpersonal thought—unconscious thought that underlies conscious, pre-conscious, and repressed ideation.
46. The cognitive operations that mediate vision, language-comprehension, and musical ability are subpersonal.
47. Your mind figures out how to convert sensory disturbances into visual images—but not you, i.e., not your self.
48. It would be viciously regressive to say that you—your self—carried out cognitive operations underlying sense-perception.
49. Subpersonal, non-iconic ideation becomes hewed to sequences of expression-images in the way geometrical propositions can be hewed to arithmetical propositions.
50. Concepts are not constituents of consciousness; so far as they are conscious, they are access-conscious, not consciousness-constitutive.

LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT
--------------------
51. Although symbol-manipulations facilitate ratiocinative operations, anything that one can think with the help of symbols one can think without them.
52. Linguistic competence enhances cognitive competence; knowing a language makes one more intelligent than one would otherwise be.
53. The relationship borne by Adam Smith's cognitive competence to his linguistic competence is constitutive, not causal.
54. Linguistic competence is a component of cognitive competence, not merely a precursor of it.
55. It seems to be a conceptual necessity, not an idiosyncrasy of human psychology, that complex cogitations need linguistic vehicles.
56. One's having the cognitive wherewithal to write a treatise is constitutively related to one's linguistic competence.
57. Berkeley was right that we don't grasp universals except by way of linguistic symbols, but wrong that our minds cannot grasp universals non-linguistically.
58. Our minds must grasp universals non-linguistically if linguistic expressions are to mean anything to us.
59. Berkeley conflated images with concepts, using "idea" to refer to both.

EMPIRICISM AND PERCEPTION
-------------------------
60. Perception is not mere sensation; perceptions are articulated sensations, and the articulations correspond to conceptual knowledge.
61. There is probably a conceptual dimension to perception.
62. Different expressions are associated with different kinds of phenomenology.
63. Congenial phenomenology alerts us to the presence of positive properties (truthfulness, validity) in expression-image series.
64. Pleasant affects alert us to structural features in works of music, paintings, or buildings; unpleasant affects alert us to their absence.

EMOTIONS AND EMPIRICIST ERROR
-----------------------------
65. Empiricists are forced to espouse radically implausible views concerning affect and emotion because they mistakenly treat relations as properties.
66. Colors, tastes, and fragrances are not "purely" subjective as empiricists claim.
67. Colors are properties of three-place relations, not two-place relations between observer and object.
68. The empiricist wrongly puts a headache in the same category as concern for a child's welfare, treating each as equally non-cognitive "sentiment."
69. If you stopped caring about your kidnapped child's welfare, your sphere of awareness would have shrunk; stopping a headache would not diminish awareness.

PSYCHOPATHY AND SOCIOPATHY
--------------------------
70. A psychopath is someone who doesn't have a conscience and never had one to begin with.
71. A sociopath is someone who had a conscience but ceased to have one.
72. Sociopathogenesis is identical with, or largely constitutive of, a certain sort of rationalization.
73. Sociopaths are people who "sell out" and "die inside," becoming empty husks that are but caricatures of their former selves.
74. Psychopathy is a kind of perpetual infantilism.
75. Unlike the sociopath, the psychopath never sold out; he had nothing to sell because he never had values.
