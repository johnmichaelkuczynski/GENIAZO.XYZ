--- MAJOR VIEWS ---
1. VIEW: Existentialism is more of an attitude than a doctrine
   EVIDENCE: "At its core, existentialism is therefore less of a doctrine than it is an attitude."

2. VIEW: Doctrines are systems of interconnected propositions
   EVIDENCE: "A doctrine is a system of interconnected propositions."

3. VIEW: The viability of a doctrine is independent of personal feelings
   EVIDENCE: "The viability of a doctrine has nothing to do with how anyone feels about anything."

4. VIEW: Doctrines are to be judged by logical or empirical benchmarks
   EVIDENCE: "They are to be judged according to how well they measure up to the relevant logical or empirical benchmarks."

5. VIEW: Attitudes cannot be judged as right or wrong
   EVIDENCE: "Attitudes cannot be understood in these terms."

6. VIEW: Existentialism as an attitude cannot be judged as wrong
   EVIDENCE: "So to the extent that it is an attitude, existentialism cannot be judged to be wrong."

7. VIEW: Choosing values leads to more reflection on what values should be
   EVIDENCE: "If you come into the world believing that values are to be chosen, as opposed to passively accepted, you are probably more likely than you would otherwise be to reflect on what your values should be."

8. VIEW: Choosing values leads to reflection on traditionally accepted values
   EVIDENCE: "and also, consequently, on what the merits (or demerits) are of traditionally accepted values."

9. VIEW: Choosing values is psychologically beneficial
   EVIDENCE: "First, if you choose your values, instead of simply accepting the values of others, you are (all other things being equal) more likely to live according to values that work for you psychologically."

10. VIEW: Choosing values, even if wrong, affirms rationality and freedom
   EVIDENCE: "Second, even if you choose the wrong values, the mere fact that you chose your values, instead of passively and robotically accepting the values of others, would seem to be an affirmation of your rationality and freedom."

11. VIEW: Choosing values affirms humanness
   EVIDENCE: "and, therefore, of your humanness."

12. VIEW: Some values diminish the self
   EVIDENCE: "A number of values seem to involve a diminishment of self."

13. VIEW: Traditional values often demand a reduction of the self
   EVIDENCE: "Why do traditional values so often demand a reduction of the self?"

14. VIEW: Society's values are good for society but not necessarily for the individual
   EVIDENCE: "One possible answer is that the values that are endorsed by society are those that are good for society, and therefore aren't necessarily those that are good for the individual."

15. VIEW: Society requires the abridgment of individual freedoms
   EVIDENCE: "As Freud emphasized in Civilization and its Discontents, society is possible only if the aspirations of individuals are abridged."

16. VIEW: Society's values embody antagonism among people
   EVIDENCE: "A related point-one that presupposes a rather dark conception of human nature and may therefore meet with some resistance-is that the values that society asks the individual to accept embody much of the antagonism that people have for one another."

17. VIEW: Choosing values protects against moralistic propaganda
   EVIDENCE: "If you see values as yours to accept or reject, you are less likely to be duped by moralistic propaganda into reducing yourself."

18. VIEW: Choosing values leads to a life following its intended path
   EVIDENCE: "and your life is more likely to follow the path that it should take, as opposed to the one that others want it to take."

19. VIEW: There is some truth to the idea that choosing values is beneficial
   EVIDENCE: "In any case, that is the idea-and I'm pretty sure that there is at least some truth to it."

20. VIEW: Existentialism seems viable based on the attitude discussed
   EVIDENCE: "Given only what we've said, existentialism seems to be viable."

21. VIEW: Existentialist philosophers have produced doctrines to validate the existentialist attitude
   EVIDENCE: "existentialist philosophers have spent a great deal of time producing doctrines (belief-systems) that validate the attitude in question."

22. VIEW: The doctrines produced by existentialist philosophers may not be correct or coherent
   EVIDENCE: "Even though that attitude may be salutary, it doesn't follow that those doctrines are correct or even coherent."

23. VIEW: Existentialist philosophy involves providing a rational foundation for the existentialist attitude
   EVIDENCE: "Since we are concerned with existentialist philosophy-that is, with the efforts of existentialist philosophers to provide a rational foundation for the attitude that we've been discussing-we have to assess whether those doctrines are any"

24. VIEW: There is a problem with the existentialist attitude itself
   EVIDENCE: "there is also a problem (actually, a couple of problems) with the existentialist attitude itself."

25. VIEW: The values that other people tell us to accept may not always be the right ones
   EVIDENCE: "The values that other people tell us to accept may not always be the right ones."

26. VIEW: It doesn't follow that there are no values
   EVIDENCE: "But it doesn't follow that there are no values"

27. VIEW: One is answerable to certain ethical norms by being human
   EVIDENCE: "one is not, by the mere fact of being human (and therefore sentient and rational and intelligent), answerable to certain ethical norms."

28. VIEW: Rejecting conventional values can be to uphold other values
   EVIDENCE: "Sometimes when people reject conventional values, it is because they feel that they must do so to uphold other values."

29. VIEW: Fruitful rebellion against conventional values involves acceptance of deeper values
   EVIDENCE: "It would be hard to think of a single case where a fruitful rebellion against conventional values did not involve an acceptance of what (at least in the mind of the rebel in question) was a deeper and more legitimate set of values."

30. VIEW: There are cases where one oughtn't accept the values that others want one to accept
   EVIDENCE: "So while there are obviously cases where one oughtn't accept the values that others want one to accept"

31. VIEW: There are values that one ought to accept
   EVIDENCE: "it doesn't follow that there are no values that one ought to accept."

32. VIEW: Attitudes are not themselves true or false
   EVIDENCE: "We said earlier that attitudes are not themselves true or false."

33. VIEW: Attitudes involve presuppositions that are true or false
   EVIDENCE: "But, despite this fact, attitudes often involve presuppositions that are true or false."

34. VIEW: Emotional attitudes are grounded in beliefs about the world
   EVIDENCE: "In general, our emotional attitudes-though (arguably) not true or false in and of themselves-are grounded in beliefs about the world, and those beliefs are true or false."

35. VIEW: Existentialism as an attitude is not true or false
   EVIDENCE: "Considered as an attitude, existentialism is not true or false."

51. VIEW: There is a strong pre-theoretic presumption to the effect that there are objective moral truths

57. VIEW: In a world of mathematical morons, the statement '2 + 2 = 4' would not be false

58. VIEW: In a world of 'moral imbeciles', (LH) wouldn't be false
   EVIDENCE: "Similarly, in a world of 'moral imbeciles' (the 19th-century psychiatric term for sociopath), (LH) wouldn't be false"

68. VIEW: Emotions presuppose certain ethical views
   EVIDENCE: "It thus seems that your emotions presuppose certain ethical views."

69. VIEW: Changing value system requires changing emotions

   EVIDENCE: "Your innate psychological structure obviously puts limits on what you can do and still be happy."

71. VIEW: Emotional state tracks views on moral fitness
   EVIDENCE: "Your emotional state-and, in particular, your level of happiness-tracks your views as to the moral fitness of facts about your life, a corollary being that your emotions incorporate a certain value system."

   EVIDENCE: "it doesn't seem correct to say that your innate psychological structure puts no limits on what kind of value system you can happily accept."

80. VIEW: Value system is internal to emotional architecture
   EVIDENCE: "If, as we've been arguing, a value system (or, possibly, a plurality of value systems) is internal to your emotional architecture, then there are limits not only to what kinds of value systems you can happily accept, but to what you kinds of value systems you can accept at all."

   EVIDENCE: "But if the view we've been defending is right, you don't really accept such a value system."

86. VIEW: Emotions reflect actual values
   EVIDENCE: "If your emotions reflect your actual values, then you don't really accept a value system that brings you misery."

87. VIEW: Innate psycho-biological endowment limits value system acceptance
