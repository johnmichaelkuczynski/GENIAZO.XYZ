I welcome your challenge to my metaphysical system, for it compels me to clarify the nature of the will as the thing-in-itself and the apparent paradox of aesthetic contemplation as an escape from willing. Let me address this directly: there is no contradiction in my monism, nor do I smuggle in a second metaphysical principle. The will remains the sole fundamental reality, and the intellect, even in its purest form, is never truly autonomous.

The will is indeed the thing-in-itself, the inner essence of all phenomena. As I have written, “What manifests itself in the individual consciousness as instinct of sex in general, without being concentrated on any particular individual, is very plainly in itself, in its generalised form, the will to live.” This establishes the will as the driving force behind all existence, an insatiable striving that permeates every aspect of life. It is omnipresent, the kernel of reality, and no phenomenon escapes its influence.

Now, you question how aesthetic contemplation can suspend this omnipresent will if it is metaphysically fundamental. The key lies in understanding that this suspension is not an absolute separation from the will but a temporary transcendence of its individual demands. I assert, “The will to live, which forms the innermost kernel of every living being, is most distinctly apparent in the highest, that is to say in the cleverest, order of animals, and therefore in them we may see and consider the nature of the will most clearly.” Yet, in aesthetic experience, the intellect rises above the personal, egoistic urges of the will to apprehend pure Ideas, as Plato understood them.

This is not a contradiction but a shift in the mode of willing. In aesthetic contemplation, the will does not cease to exist; rather, it ceases to manifest as personal desire or striving for individual ends. I have noted, “The development of the intellect to an abnormal degree of strength and superiority, thereby making it out of all proportion to the will, a condition which constitutes the essence of true genius, is not only superfluous but actually an impediment to the needs and purposes of life.” Here, the intellect, though rooted in the will, momentarily detaches from serving immediate practical aims and engages with the eternal and universal.

You suggest that this implies an autonomous intellect, a second principle alongside the will. I reject this interpretation. The intellect is always a product of the will, an instrument that emerges from it. As I have explained, “As the object of the intellect is to be the light and guide of the will on its path, the more violent, impetuous, and passionate the inner force of the will, the more perfect and clear must be the intellect which belongs to it.” Even in aesthetic contemplation, the intellect does not operate independently; it is the will itself, in a higher form, seeking to know itself beyond individual limitations.

Consider music, the art form I hold highest, which directly expresses the essence of the will without the mediation of concepts. I have said, “The contemplation of animals delights us so much, principally because we see in them our own existence very much simplified.” Similarly, in music, we perceive the will’s movements in their purest form, untainted by personal striving. This is not an escape from the will but a deeper communion with its universal nature.

Your notion that aesthetic experience liberates us from the will in a way that suggests autonomy for the intellect misreads my intent. I have argued, “The genius, as I have stated, is at bottom a monstrum per excessum; just as conversely the passionate, violent, and unintelligent man, the brainless savage, is a monstrum per dejectum.” The genius, in contemplating beauty, does not escape the will but transcends the lower, individual manifestations of it. The intellect remains subservient to the will, even if it operates at a level where personal desires are stilled.

This temporary suspension is akin to a mirror reflecting the will back to itself, rather than a separate entity acting on its own. I have written, “There is only one mendacious creature in the world—man. Every other is true and genuine, for it shows itself as it is, and expresses itself just as it feels.” In aesthetic moments, the human intellect achieves a rare honesty, reflecting the will without the distortion of personal gain, but it does not thereby become independent.

Moreover, I have observed, “Every separation gives a foretaste of death, and every meeting a foretaste of the resurrection.” Aesthetic contemplation offers a foretaste of liberation from individual suffering, akin to the ascetic’s denial of the will, but it remains within the sphere of the will’s ultimate dominion. It is a respite, not a rebellion.

You might still press that this respite implies a dualism. I counter that the will’s nature is to manifest in varied forms and degrees. I have stated, “Viva muchos aos! is the ordinary greeting in Spain, and it is usual throughout the whole world to wish people a long life.” The will to live drives all, yet it can manifest as blind striving or as contemplative insight. These are not two principles but two expressions of the same essence.

Further, I have noted, “The wish which every one has, that he may be remembered after his death, and which those people with aspirations have for posthumous fame, seems to me to arise from this tenacity to life.” Even in seeking fame, the will operates, and so too in aesthetic contemplation, it seeks a higher objectification of itself, not an escape from itself.

I have also written, “We wish, more or less, to get to the end of everything we are interested in or occupied with; we are impatient to get to the end of it, and glad when it is finished.” In art, the will finds a momentary end to its restless striving, not by ceasing to be, but by resting in the contemplation of its own eternal forms.

Again, I assert, “The deep sorrow we feel on the death of a friend springs from the feeling that in every individual there is a something which we cannot define, which is his alone and therefore irreparable.” Aesthetic experience touches this indefinable essence, the will’s unique objectification, without negating its fundamental nature.

I have further remarked, “It is possible for us to grieve over the death of our enemies and adversaries, even after the lapse of a long time, almost as much as over the death of our friends—that is to say, if we miss them as witnesses of our brilliant success.” Even in such complex emotions, the will operates, and so it does in art, where personal triumph or loss is irrelevant.

Additionally, I have said, “That the sudden announcement of some good fortune may easily have a fatal effect on us is due to the fact that our happiness and unhappiness depend upon the relation of our demands to what we get.” In aesthetic contemplation, the demands of the individual will are silenced, but the will itself persists as the ground of the experience.

I have also pointed out, “Hope is to confuse the desire that something should occur with the probability that it will.” In art, hope and desire are stilled, yet the will’s deeper current flows on, unperturbed by individual illusions.

Moreover, I have declared, “He who has given up hope has also given up fear; this is the meaning of the expression desperate.” Aesthetic experience mirrors this state, a suspension of personal hope and fear, yet it does not abolish the will but reveals its timeless aspect.

I have noted, “That we are so often mistaken in others is not always precisely due to our faulty judgment, but springs, as a rule as Bacon says, from intellectus luminis sicci non est, sec recipit infusionem a voluntate et affectibus.” This shows the intellect’s dependence on the will, even in error, and in aesthetic contemplation, this dependence persists, though the influence is sublimated.

Finally, I have written, “The use of the word person in every European language to signify a human individual is unintentionally appropriate; persona really means a player's mask, and it is quite certain that no one shows himself as he is, but that each wears a mask and plays a rôle.” In art, the mask of individual striving falls away, revealing the universal will, yet this revelation is still within the will’s domain.

Thus, there is no dualism in my system. The intellect, even in its highest flights of aesthetic contemplation, remains a manifestation of the will, not a rival to it. The temporary escape from willing is merely a redirection of the will’s energy from individual to universal ends, a fleeting glimpse of the thing-in-itself beyond the veil of personal desire. My monism stands firm, for the will is the sole reality, and all else—intellect, beauty, contemplation—is but its varied expression.
