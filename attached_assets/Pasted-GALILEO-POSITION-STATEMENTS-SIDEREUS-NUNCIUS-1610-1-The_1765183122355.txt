PHYSICS 

GALILEO'S PHYSICS DISCOVERIES

I. KINEMATICS OF FALLING BODIES

All bodies fall with the same acceleration regardless of weight — Refuted Aristotle's claim that heavier bodies fall faster. In a vacuum, a feather and a cannonball fall together.
Free fall is uniformly accelerated motion — Velocity increases linearly with time, not with distance.
Distance fallen is proportional to the square of elapsed time — d ∝ t². The fundamental law of falling bodies.
The odd-number rule — Distances covered in successive equal time intervals are as 1:3:5:7... (follows from d ∝ t²).
The mean-speed theorem applies to falling bodies — Total distance equals that which would be covered at the mean velocity over the interval.
Speed acquired in fall depends only on height, not on path — A body falling vertically and one descending an incline from the same height reach the bottom with equal speeds.
Inclined planes dilute gravity — Acceleration along an incline is proportional to the sine of the angle. This allowed Galileo to "slow down" gravity for measurement.


II. PROJECTILE MOTION

Projectile motion is compound motion — Composed of two independent motions: uniform horizontal and uniformly accelerated vertical.
The trajectory of a projectile is a parabola — Follows mathematically from the composition of uniform and accelerated motion.
Horizontal and vertical motions are independent — A ball dropped and a ball fired horizontally from the same height hit the ground simultaneously.
Maximum range occurs at 45° launch angle — For a given initial speed on level ground.
Complementary angles yield equal ranges — 30° and 60°, or 20° and 70°, produce the same horizontal distance.
Range tables can be computed mathematically — Galileo produced gunnery tables from his parabolic theory.


III. THE PRINCIPLE OF INERTIA

A body in motion tends to remain in motion — Without external interference, a moving body continues moving. Overturned 2,000 years of Aristotelian physics requiring continuous causation.
Rest is not privileged over uniform motion — No internal experiment distinguishes a stationary system from one in uniform motion. (Galilean relativity.)
No force is required to maintain uniform motion — Force causes change in motion, not motion itself.
The ship's hold thought experiment — Butterflies fly, fish swim, drops fall identically whether the ship is docked or sailing smoothly. Motion below decks reveals nothing about motion of the ship.


IV. PENDULUM PHENOMENA

Isochronism of the pendulum — For small amplitudes, period is independent of amplitude. A pendulum swinging through a large arc takes the same time as one swinging through a small arc (approximately).
Pendulum period is independent of the bob's weight — A lead bob and a cork bob of equal length swing with equal periods.
Pendulum period depends on length — Longer pendulums swing more slowly. Period proportional to the square root of length (though Galileo didn't state it in that form).
Pendulums can serve as timekeepers — Galileo proposed pendulum-regulated clocks; Huygens built them.
Sympathetic resonance of pendulums — Pendulums of equal length transfer energy; those of different lengths do not.


V. ACOUSTICS AND VIBRATING STRINGS

Pitch is determined by frequency of vibration — Higher frequency means higher pitch.
Frequency of a vibrating string is inversely proportional to its length — Halving the length doubles the frequency (raises pitch by an octave).
Frequency depends on tension — Greater tension produces higher pitch.
Frequency depends on the string's density/thickness — Thicker or denser strings vibrate more slowly.
Consonance explained by frequency ratios — Octave (2:1), fifth (3:2), fourth (4:3). Simple ratios please the ear; complex ratios sound dissonant.
Resonance in strings — A vibrating string can excite sympathetic vibration in another string tuned to the same pitch or a harmonic.
Scraped plate produces pitch — The spacing of grooves determines frequency. Galileo noted a bronze plate scraped by a chisel.


VI. STRENGTH OF MATERIALS

The strength of a beam does not scale proportionally with size — Doubling all dimensions of a beam does not double its strength. Strength scales with cross-sectional area; weight scales with volume.
There are natural limits to size — Giants and enormous structures are mechanically impossible. Large animals require proportionally thicker bones.
A beam breaks at the wall — Galileo analyzed the cantilever problem: a beam projecting horizontally from a wall fractures at the point of support.
Resistance to fracture depends on cross-sectional dimensions — Galileo attempted to calculate breaking strength from geometry.
Hollow tubes are stronger per unit weight than solid rods — Nature exploits this in bones and plant stems.
Geometric similarity does not imply mechanical similarity — Scale models do not predict behavior of full-scale structures directly.


VII. HYDROSTATICS AND FLOATING BODIES

Bodies float or sink according to density, not shape — Contra Aristotelians who attributed floating to flat shape. A thin sheet of lead sinks; a lead-hulled ship floats because the hull encloses air.
Buoyancy depends on volume of displaced fluid — Archimedes' principle defended and clarified against contemporary misunderstandings.
Ice floats because it is less dense than water — Not because of its flat shape, as Aristotelians claimed.
Apparent weight loss in fluid equals weight of displaced fluid — Quantitative buoyancy relation.


VIII. VACUUM AND AIR PRESSURE

The vacuum has physical effects — Galileo noted the force required to separate two smooth plates and the limited height to which suction pumps could raise water.
Nature's "horror of the vacuum" has a finite strength — Water columns break at about 10 meters. There's a measurable limit to how much nature "resists" vacuum.
Suction pumps work by air pressure — Galileo approached but did not fully articulate this; Torricelli completed the insight.
The "force of vacuum" can be measured — Galileo devised experiments to quantify the resistance to separation of surfaces.


IX. MECHANICS AND SIMPLE MACHINES

The principle of virtual velocities (implicit) — In balanced systems, what is gained in force is lost in distance. Underlies analysis of levers, pulleys, inclined planes.
Correct analysis of the inclined plane — Force required to hold a body on an incline is proportional to the sine of the angle. Resolved ambiguities from earlier treatments.
Mechanical advantage has no free lunch — Machines multiply force by sacrificing speed/distance. Work in equals work out (before that concept was formalized).


X. PROPERTIES OF MOTION

Velocity is a continuous quantity — A body passes through all intermediate speeds; it doesn't jump instantaneously from one speed to another.
Acceleration is change of velocity over time — Galileo distinguished uniform velocity from uniformly accelerated motion with precision no predecessor achieved.
Motion is relative — The same motion can be described differently from different reference frames. There is no absolute standard of rest detectable by mechanical experiments.
Circular motion is not "natural" — Though Galileo sometimes wavered on this, his analysis points toward recognizing that circular motion requires continuous deflection (later: centripetal force).


XI. PERCUSSION AND IMPACT

The force of percussion is immense but brief — A hammer blow delivers enormous momentary force. Galileo struggled to quantify this but recognized its importance.
Accumulated motion produces percussion effects — A slowly raised hammer has less effect than one swung through an arc. The motion acquired during the swing matters.
Percussion force exceeds any static weight — No matter how heavy a dead weight, a sufficiently rapid impact produces greater instantaneous force.


XII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

Controlled experimental variation isolates variables — Change one factor at a time (length, weight, angle) and measure the effect.
Idealization is necessary for law discovery — Abstract from air resistance, friction, imperfect sphericity to discover the underlying mathematical law.
Measurement and quantification are essential — Physics advances by measuring, timing, and computing, not by verbal disputation.
Reproducibility validates findings — Experiments can and should be repeated by others.
Mathematical relations are the form of physical laws — The laws of nature are ratios, proportions, geometric relations—not qualitative tendencies.

Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger, 1610) — His first astronomical treatise reporting telescopic discoveries: Jupiter's moons, lunar craters and mountains, the stellar composition of the Milky Way. This work made him famous across Europe.
Letters on Sunspots (1613) — Observations of sunspots with increasingly explicit defense of Copernicanism.
Il Saggiatore (The Assayer, 1623) — A methodological polemic occasioned by a dispute over comets, famous for the declaration that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics.
Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (Dialogo, 1632) — His masterpiece comparing Ptolemaic and Copernican cosmology through a three-character dialogue. This led directly to his trial and condemnation by the Inquisition.
Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi, 1638) — Written under house arrest and smuggled to Leiden for publication. Covers the strength of materials and the science of motion (kinematics). This is the foundational text for classical mechanics and arguably his most enduring scientific contribution.
