Here are 5 specific positions or arguments John Locke held on each of the 20 major topics from his work.

---

### **Core Philosophical & Epistemological Topics**

**1. Tabula Rasa (The Blank Slate)**
*   The mind at birth is like "white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas."
*   There are **no innate practical principles** (moral rules) because virtue and vice vary across cultures.
*   There are **no innate speculative principles** (like logical axioms) because children and the unlearned are unaware of them.
*   The very idea of *innateness* is used as a lazy intellectual shortcut to avoid the hard work of tracing ideas to their origin.
*   This theory supports universal educability and undermines claims of natural, inherited intellectual superiority.

**2. Empiricism**
*   All knowledge is **derived from experience**; the two sources of experience are *sensation* (external) and *reflection* (internal, on the mind's own operations).
*   **No idea is innate**; even complex abstract ideas can be broken down into simple ideas that originated in sensation or reflection.
*   The mind's initial role is largely **passive** in receiving simple ideas, but it becomes **active** in combining, comparing, and abstracting them.
*   This leads to a **modest, probabilistic view of knowledge** rather than a dogmatic, rationalist one.
*   It places a limit on human understanding: we cannot have knowledge of essences or the "real constitutions" of substances.

**3. Ideas and Their Origins**
*   **Simple Ideas** are the basic, irreducible building blocks of thought (e.g., yellow, cold, hard) and are passively received.
*   **Complex Ideas** are formed by the active mind combining simple ideas (e.g., beauty, gratitude, a unicorn).
*   Ideas of **Sensation** come from external objects affecting our senses (e.g., the idea of a rose).
*   Ideas of **Reflection** come from the mind observing its own internal operations (e.g., the ideas of thinking, doubting, willing).
*   The mind also forms ideas through the processes of **composition, relation, and abstraction**.

**4. Primary and Secondary Qualities**
*   **Primary Qualities** are "utterly inseparable" from an object and exist in the object itself regardless of perception (e.g., solidity, extension, figure, motion/number).
*   **Secondary Qualities** are nothing in the objects themselves but "powers to produce various sensations in us" (e.g., colors, sounds, tastes). They are dependent on a perceiver.
*   The **resemblance thesis**: Our ideas of primary qualities *resemble* the qualities as they exist in the object, while our ideas of secondary qualities do *not*.
*   This distinction is a **cornerstone of the new mechanistic science** (Boyle, Newton), separating objective, measurable properties from subjective experience.
*   It illustrates how our sensory experience is a representation of the world, not a direct, perfect copy.

**5. Personal Identity and Consciousness**
*   Personal identity is **not based on substance** (neither the sameness of the immaterial soul nor the material body).
*   Personal identity is the **sameness of *consciousness***, particularly **memory**.
*   A person is "a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places."
*   You are the same person as your past self if you can **remember the experiences and actions** of that past self.
*   This has **profound moral and legal implications**: You are justly held responsible only for the actions your present consciousness can appropriate as your own.

**6. The Limits of Human Understanding**
*   We must recognize the "**weakness of our faculties**" and the boundaries of our understanding.
*   Our knowledge is limited to the **ideas we have from experience**; we lack ideas of the real essences of substances.
*   We cannot have **certain knowledge of the necessary connection** between cause and effect in the natural world (a point Hume later expanded).
*   The proper role of philosophy is to be a "**under-labourer**" to the sciences, clearing away conceptual rubbish rather than making grand metaphysical claims.
*   We must therefore **tolerate differing opinions** in areas where certain knowledge is impossible (a bridge to his religious toleration).

### **Political Philosophy & Government**

**7. Natural Rights**
*   In the state of nature, all humans are in "a state of perfect freedom" and "a state also of equality."
*   These rights are **inalienable**—they cannot be legitimately given away.
*   The most fundamental natural rights are **life, liberty, and property**.
*   The **right of self-preservation** is the most basic, from which other rights flow.
*   In the state of nature, everyone has the **executive power of the law of nature**—the right to enforce these rights and punish transgressors.

**8. The Social Contract**
*   The great reason for forming political society is to **remedy the inconveniences of the state of nature** (uncertainty, bias, lack of power in enforcement).
*   Government is formed by the **consent of the governed**, who agree to give up their individual executive power.
*   This contract creates a **fiduciary trust**: government is entrusted with power for the specific end of protecting natural rights.
*   If the government violates this trust (breaches the contract), power **reverts to the people**.
*   **Tacit consent** is given simply by enjoying the benefits of a government's dominion (e.g., walking on its roads).

**9. Property and Labor Theory**
*   God gave the world to mankind in common.
*   An individual acquires **private property** by mixing their **labor** with a natural resource.
*   **Labor adds value** to nature's raw materials, creating almost all economic value. (A planted acre of land is 10x more valuable than an uncultivated acre).
*   The **"spoilage limitation"**: One can only appropriate as much as one can use before it spoils ("as much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils").
*   The **invention of money** (a durable, non-spoiling store of value) allows for the legitimate, unequal accumulation of property beyond the spoilage limit.

**10. Separation of Powers**
*   He identified **three powers** in a commonwealth: Legislative, Executive, and Federative (the power of war, peace, and alliances).
*   The **Legislative power is supreme** but is not arbitrary; it is bound by natural law and its fiduciary duty.
*   The **Executive and Legislative powers must be separate** to prevent those who make the laws from executing them in a self-serving manner.
*   The **Federative power** (external affairs) is distinct but is almost always placed in the same hands as the Executive for practical reasons.
*   There is no separate "Judicial" power in Locke's scheme; adjudication is a function of the executive.

**11. The Right of Revolution**
*   When a government **systematically violates its trust**—by encroaching on property, denying due process, dissolving the legislature, or placing itself above the law—it rebels against the people.
*   In such a case, the government effectively **dissolves itself**, and power returns to the people.
*   The people then have the **right, and sometimes the duty, to revolt** and establish a new government.
*   This right is not for "trivial" matters but for a "**long train of abuses**" that reveals a design of tyranny.
*   The fear of this popular right serves as a necessary **check on governmental power**.

**12. Toleration**
*   **Civil government's interest is only in civil goods** (life, liberty, health, property), not in the salvation of souls.
*   **Genuine religious belief cannot be coerced** by force; force can only create hypocrites.
*   Churches are **voluntary societies** from which one can freely withdraw.
*   **Toleration should be extended to all who do not threaten the state or the rights of others.**
*   **Limits of Toleration**: It should *not* be extended to 1) Those who owe allegiance to a foreign prince (e.g., Catholics, in his view); 2) Atheists (because oaths and covenants, the bonds of society, are meaningless to them); 3) Those whose religion leads them to sedition or the persecution of others.

### **Society, Religion, and Education**

**13. The State of Nature**
*   It is a state of **liberty, not license**; it is governed by the Law of Nature, which is reason.
*   It is **pre-political but not pre-moral**; the Law of Nature obliges all persons.
*   Its chief "inconvenience" is the lack of a **common, impartial judge** and effective enforcement power, leaving each individual as judge in their own case.
*   It is a **theoretical tool for reasoning**, not necessarily a historical claim about all humanity.
*   It demonstrates that political authority is **not natural** (like paternal authority) but **conventional** and created for a specific purpose.

**14. Religious Freedom and the Role of the Church**
*   The **magistrate's power is limited to outward force** for civil ends, while **true religion concerns inward persuasion of the mind**.
*   The **care of souls is not committed to the civil magistrate**.
*   A church is "a **free and voluntary society**" instituted for the public worship of God.
*   No church has jurisdiction over another, and **excommunication is its ultimate penalty** (not civil punishment).
*   The state must be **indifferent** to different religious denominations as long as they are politically peaceable.

**15. Faith and Reason**
*   He defined their distinct spheres: **Reason** is the discovery of the certainty or probability of truths from observation or deduction. **Faith** is assent to revelation-based propositions not discoverable by reason.
*   **No proposition can be both an article of faith and contrary to reason.** If a claimed revelation contradicts clear intuition or demonstration, it must be rejected.
*   **Faith must be founded on reason** in one crucial aspect: we must use reason to judge whether something is a genuine revelation.
*   **Matters beyond reason** (e.g., the resurrection of the dead) are the proper objects of faith.
*   Where reason can give clear knowledge (e.g., in morality, he argued), revelation is unnecessary.

**16. Education**
*   The **primary goal is virtue and character**, not scholarly learning. "That which a gentleman desires for his son, beyond all other things... is the welfare of his soul and body is virtue and wisdom."
*   Education must form **good habits** through repeated practice, not just by rules (e.g., teach courage by not coddling a child's every fear).
*   **Praise and shame are more effective motivators** than corporal punishment.
*   **Learning should be made engaging**, not a burden; where possible, use play and curiosity.
*   The curriculum should be **practical**, emphasizing rhetoric, logic, modern languages, accounting, and law over a purely classical education.

**17. The Law of Opinion or Reputation**
*   Alongside Divine Law and Civil Law, this is one of the **three "laws"** humans use to judge action.
*   It is the de facto standard of **"virtue and vice"** in any given society—what is praised or blamed.
*   The **desire for a good reputation and fear of disgrace** is a powerful, often the most powerful, motivator for human behavior.
*   It explains the **diversity of moral codes** across cultures without resorting to moral relativism, as it is distinct from the true, universal Law of Nature.
*   It is a key mechanism of **social cohesion and informal regulation**.

### **Foundational & Miscellaneous**

**18. Money and Economic Value**
*   The invention of money arose from a **tacit agreement** among people to value a durable commodity (like gold).
*   Money allowed for the **legitimate accumulation of property beyond the spoilage limitation**, as it does not decay.
*   This **unequal accumulation of wealth is justified** because it does not waste resources and benefits society through increased productivity.
*   The **interest rate should be determined by the market**, not set by law. (He wrote against legal caps on interest rates).
*   Government's role in the economy is to ensure the **stability and reliability of money** (he was involved in debates on recoinage).

**19. The Foundation of Knowledge in Sensation and Reflection**
*   These are the **"two fountains of knowledge"** from which all our ideas originate.
*   **Sensation** provides all the materials for thinking about the external, physical world.
*   **Reflection** provides all the materials for thinking about the internal, mental world (operations of our own mind).
*   The understanding is initially **furnished** with ideas from these two sources alone.
*   Even the most abstract intellectual and moral ideas (like infinity, God, or obligation) are **complex ideas constructed** from simple ideas of sensation and reflection.

**20. Critique of Innate Ideas and Principles**
*   **Universal consent is not proof of innateness**, as there are no principles to which all humanity assents.
*   Children and "idiots" show **no awareness** of supposed innate principles, which they should if such principles were truly innate.
*   The actual process of learning moral or logical rules **demonstrates they are acquired** through instruction and experience.
*   The doctrine of innate ideas is used to **impose arbitrary authority** ("accept this because it's innate, don't question it").
*   Clearing away this error is the **first step in his empirical project** to provide a proper, observable origin for all human ideas.
