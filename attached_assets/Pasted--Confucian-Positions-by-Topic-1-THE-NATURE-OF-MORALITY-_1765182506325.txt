# Confucian Positions by Topic

## 1. THE NATURE OF MORALITY

1. **Morality is grounded in human nature but requires cultivation.** Humans possess the capacity for *ren* (benevolence) but must develop it through effort, learning, and practice—it does not simply emerge spontaneously.

2. ***Ren* is the root of all virtue.** Benevolence/humaneness is the foundational moral quality from which other virtues (righteousness, propriety, wisdom, faithfulness) derive their meaning and coherence.

3. **Morality is irreducibly relational.** Moral obligations arise from and are defined by one's specific relationships—there is no abstract, context-free morality detached from roles and bonds.

4. **The Way (*dao*) is objective but must be personally realized.** The moral order is real and discoverable, not invented, but each person must internalize and embody it through their own cultivation.

5. **Moral knowledge requires both learning and reflection.** Neither book-learning alone nor independent thinking alone suffices—genuine moral understanding integrates transmitted wisdom with personal insight.

6. **Character is primary; actions are expressions of character.** The goal is to become a certain kind of person (a *junzi*), from which right action naturally flows, rather than merely performing correct external behaviors.

7. **Intention and inner state are morally essential.** An action performed without the proper feeling or attitude—ritual without reverence, mourning without grief—is morally deficient even if externally correct.

8. **Morality admits of degrees of proximity.** Obligations are strongest toward those closest (family) and extend outward with diminishing intensity—love is not undifferentiated.

9. **Moral cultivation is a lifelong process with discernible stages.** Confucius described his own development from age 15 to 70 as a progressive journey toward moral freedom.

10. **The moral order and the cosmic order are continuous.** Human morality participates in and reflects the broader pattern (*dao*) governing Heaven and Earth.

## 2. SPECIFIC MORAL OBLIGATIONS

1. **Filial piety (*xiao*) is the root of virtue.** Devotion to parents is the foundation from which all other moral development proceeds and the first obligation one must fulfill.

2. **Filial piety includes gentle remonstrance.** A son should correct a parent's errors, but gently, persistently, and without abandoning respect—obedience does not mean enabling wrongdoing.

3. **Filial piety extends to ancestors through ritual.** Proper sacrificial rites and remembrance of ancestors are obligations, not optional expressions of sentiment.

4. **The five relationships (*wulun*) define the structure of obligation.** Ruler-subject, parent-child, husband-wife, elder-younger sibling, and friend-friend each carry specific reciprocal duties.

5. **Rulers must govern by moral example, not force.** A ruler's primary obligation is to embody virtue such that the people are transformed by his character, not coerced by his punishments.

6. **Ministers must serve with loyalty but not servility.** A minister should serve the state, remonstrate against error, and resign rather than participate in grave injustice.

7. **Friendship requires mutual moral improvement.** Friends are obligated to correct each other's faults—a friend who flatters rather than admonishes fails the relationship.

8. **Obligations to family take precedence over obligations to strangers.** The attempt to love all equally, without gradation, is a Mohist error that undermines the natural order of affection.

9. **Teachers and students have reciprocal obligations.** Students owe respect, diligence, and openness; teachers owe genuine instruction and concern for students' development.

10. **Age confers authority and obligation.** Elders are owed deference; in return, they bear responsibility for guidance and moral example.

## 3. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MORALITY AND TRADITION

1. **The Zhou rituals embody the accumulated wisdom of the sage-kings.** The *li* are not arbitrary conventions but crystallized moral insight refined over generations.

2. **Ritual (*li*) is the external form through which *ren* is expressed.** Without benevolence, ritual is empty; without ritual, benevolence lacks proper form—they are complementary.

3. **Tradition must be understood, not merely imitated.** Rote performance without comprehension of meaning and purpose is morally worthless—one must grasp the *why* behind inherited forms.

4. **The essence of ritual must be preserved; the accidentals may adapt.** Confucius endorsed modifying ritual objects (e.g., silk caps to hemp) when the change preserved the core meaning while adjusting to circumstances.

5. **Innovation without grounding in tradition is dangerous.** Novel moral theories that discard inherited wisdom are presumptuous and destabilizing—the burden of proof lies on the innovator.

6. **Authentic tradition can be distinguished from corruption.** By studying the classics and the examples of the sages, one can identify when later practice has deviated from original meaning.

7. **Tradition transmits what cannot be fully articulated.** Some moral knowledge is embedded in practice and can only be learned through participation, not abstract instruction.

8. **Reverence for antiquity is not nostalgia but wisdom.** The ancients achieved a moral-political order we have lost; looking backward is the path forward.

9. **The Odes, Documents, and Rites are essential to moral formation.** These texts encode the wisdom of the sages and are indispensable for cultivation.

10. **A society that abandons its traditions loses its moral foundations.** The chaos of the Spring and Autumn period resulted from abandoning the Way of the former kings.

## 4. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MORALITY AND CULTURE

1. **Cultural refinement (*wen*) and moral substance (*zhi*) must balance.** Substance without refinement is crude; refinement without substance is superficial—the *junzi* integrates both.

2. **Music has direct moral effects on character.** Different modes of music cultivate different dispositions—the Shao music is perfectly beautiful and good; the music of Zheng is licentious and corrupting.

3. **The Odes cultivate moral perception and expression.** Poetry trains one to perceive moral situations rightly and to express oneself appropriately in social contexts.

4. **Proper use of language is morally essential.** The "rectification of names" (*zhengming*) holds that using words correctly is foundational to right action and social order.

5. **Dress, comportment, and physical demeanor express and shape character.** How one sits, stands, and moves is not morally neutral—proper bearing cultivates and manifests inner virtue.

6. **Ritual participation transforms the participant.** Engaging in *li* is not mere external performance but a practice that shapes the heart and cultivates virtue.

7. **Cultural and moral cultivation are inseparable in practice.** One cannot become a *junzi* without mastering the cultural forms through which virtue is expressed and transmitted.

8. **Barbarians can be civilized through culture.** The distinction between civilized and barbarian is cultural-moral, not ethnic—those who adopt the Way become part of civilization.

9. **Aesthetic judgment and moral judgment are connected.** Sensitivity to beauty and ugliness, harmony and discord, develops capacities essential to moral perception.

10. **The arts are not mere entertainment but instruments of cultivation.** Poetry, music, and ritual form a unified curriculum for moral development.

## 5. ONE'S VARIOUS DIFFERENT MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1. **Responsibilities are role-specific and non-transferable.** What a son owes differs from what a minister owes—one cannot discharge one obligation by fulfilling another.

2. **Family obligations are primary and inalienable.** Even in cases of apparent conflict, one's duties to parents cannot simply be overridden by public duties.

3. **The famous "father-son concealment" case establishes familial priority.** A son should not testify against a father who steals a sheep—uprightness lies in protecting family, not in abstract justice.

4. **Public office creates distinct obligations.** Taking office binds one to serve the state; if the state is corrupt and unreformable, one should resign.

5. **The *junzi* serves when the Way prevails; he withdraws when it does not.** Seeking or retaining office under a corrupt regime is shameful; poverty in an unjust state is honorable.

6. **Responsibilities to self include moral cultivation.** Self-improvement is not selfishness but an obligation—one cannot fulfill responsibilities to others without developing one's own virtue.

7. **The educated bear responsibility for transmitting culture.** Those who have received the legacy of the sages must pass it on; letting it die is a moral failure.

8. **Wealth and status carry obligations of generosity and example.** The wealthy should be generous; those in high position should be models of virtue.

9. **Age-appropriate expectations govern responsibility.** What is expected of youth differs from what is expected of age; Confucius outlined life-stages with distinct duties.

10. **When obligations conflict, prioritize by relationship and role.** The closer relationship generally takes precedence; one should not sacrifice essential obligations for peripheral ones.

## 6. PERSONAL FULFILLMENT IN RELATION TO MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

1. **True fulfillment is found only in virtue.** The satisfactions of wealth, status, and sensory pleasure are unstable and shallow compared to the deep contentment of moral cultivation.

2. **Yan Hui exemplifies fulfilled poverty.** Living in a mean lane with meager food, Yan Hui never lost his joy—demonstrating that fulfillment is independent of material conditions.

3. **Learning itself is a source of joy.** "Is it not a pleasure to learn and to practice what one has learned?"—intellectual and moral cultivation are intrinsically satisfying.

4. **The *junzi* is not anxious or fearful.** Because he does not act wrongly, he has nothing to regret; inner rectitude produces equanimity.

5. **Fulfillment requires meaningful relationships.** "Is it not a joy to have friends come from afar?"—human connection, not isolation, is part of the good life.

6. **Recognition is pleasant but not necessary for fulfillment.** "Is it not the mark of a *junzi* that he is not resentful when others fail to recognize him?"—virtue does not depend on external validation.

7. **Purpose and vocation are essential to fulfillment.** The *junzi* has a mission—transmitting the Way—which gives life meaning beyond personal satisfaction.

8. **Moral failure produces lasting regret and dissatisfaction.** The petty person who gains the world through vice cannot achieve genuine peace of mind.

9. **Fulfillment comes through devotion to something beyond self.** Self-centered pursuit of happiness defeats itself; fulfillment is a byproduct of commitment to the Way.

10. **The stages of life bring different forms of fulfillment.** What satisfies at 20 differs from what satisfies at 50—moral development brings increasingly refined and stable contentment.

## 7. WHETHER PERSONAL FULFILLMENT AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY ALIGN

1. **In the fully cultivated person, desire and duty coincide perfectly.** At 70, Confucius could follow his heart's desire without transgressing—this is the goal of cultivation.

2. **Before full cultivation, tension between desire and duty is normal.** The process of moral development involves subordinating personal inclination to moral requirement until they merge.

3. **The *junzi*'s fulfillment is independent of external success.** Confucius himself failed to reform his age but maintained inner equanimity—worldly failure does not undermine moral satisfaction.

4. **The prosperous wicked are not truly happy.** Despite appearances, those who gain through vice are inwardly troubled; their seeming happiness is unstable and false.

5. **Morality and fulfillment align by nature, not by accident.** The Way corresponds to human nature rightly understood; following it fulfills what we truly are.

6. **Short-term sacrifice may be required; long-term alignment is assured.** Moral duty may demand temporary suffering, but the overall trajectory of the moral life is toward joy.

7. **The petty person mistakes pleasure for fulfillment.** Mistaking immediate gratification for genuine satisfaction, he pursues what ultimately frustrates him.

8. **Virtue brings equanimity regardless of circumstance.** The *junzi* maintains composure in poverty and disgrace because his joy has an internal source.

9. **Seeking fulfillment directly is self-defeating.** Fulfillment comes as a byproduct of moral commitment, not as a direct object of pursuit.

10. **The sage enjoys even hardship rightly endured.** When suffering is the necessary cost of moral fidelity, bearing it well becomes its own satisfaction.

## 8. HOW TO LIVE (PRACTICAL DAILY LIFE)

1. **Rise early and maintain regular schedules.** Disciplined ordering of daily life reflects and reinforces inner moral order.

2. **Eat with moderation and proper attitude.** Confucius did not eat excessively, avoided improperly prepared food, did not talk while eating, and observed proper timing for meals.

3. **Food should be appropriately cut, seasoned, and prepared.** There are correct standards for food preparation that the cultivated person observes.

4. **Dress should be appropriate to occasion and role.** Different garments suit different contexts—sacrificial, court, domestic—and the *junzi* dresses accordingly.

5. **Maintain proper posture and deportment.** Confucius did not sit in a sprawling manner; he was careful about how he stood, walked, and positioned himself.

6. **Study should occupy a significant portion of daily life.** The *junzi* constantly engages with the classics, reflects on their meaning, and practices what he learns.

7. **Daily life should include ritual observance.** Regular participation in appropriate rites—ancestral, seasonal, social—structures time and cultivates virtue.

8. **Leisure activities should be cultivating, not corrupting.** Archery, chariot-driving, music, and reading are suitable; gambling and licentious entertainment are not.

9. **Sleep should be neither excessive nor ostentatious.** Confucius did not sleep like a corpse or lounge at home like a guest.

10. **Social interactions should observe proper forms.** There are correct ways to greet, converse with, and take leave of others depending on their status and one's relationship to them.

## 9. HOW TO DEVELOP ONE'S ABILITIES

1. **Set your heart on the Way.** Moral commitment must come first; technical skills without moral direction are dangerous.

2. **Learn from the ancients through the classics.** The Odes, Documents, Rites, and Music encode the wisdom of the sages and are the primary curriculum.

3. **Combine learning with reflection.** "Learning without thinking is labor lost; thinking without learning is perilous"—both are necessary.

4. **Find a worthy teacher and learn with humility.** "When walking with two others, I always find a teacher among them"—be ready to learn from anyone who has something to teach.

5. **Practice constantly.** "Is it not a pleasure to practice what one has learned?"—cultivation requires repeated application, not mere intellectual assent.

6. **Begin with filial piety and work outward.** Moral development starts at home with family obligations, then extends to broader relationships.

7. **Cultivate the six arts.** Ritual, music, archery, chariot-driving, calligraphy, and mathematics develop different aspects of the whole person.

8. **Examine yourself daily.** "Each day I examine myself on three counts"—regular self-scrutiny is essential to identifying and correcting faults.

9. **Seek friends who will challenge and improve you.** Associate with those who are upright, sincere, and learned; avoid flatterers and the unprincipled.

10. **Be patient—cultivation takes a lifetime.** Confucius described his own development as proceeding through decades; there are no shortcuts.

## 10. HOW TO BE HAPPY

1. **Joy comes from learning and practicing virtue.** The opening lines of the *Analects* identify learning, friendship, and equanimity as sources of genuine pleasure.

2. **The *junzi* is free from anxiety and fear.** Inner rectitude eliminates the sources of psychological disturbance that plague the morally compromised.

3. **Three pleasures are beneficial; three are harmful.** Beneficial: pleasure in ritual and music properly performed, in praising others' good qualities, in having worthy friends. Harmful: pleasure in arrogance, idle wandering, and dissolute enjoyment.

4. **Poverty with the Way is preferable to wealth without it.** Better to eat coarse rice and drink water while possessing virtue than to live in luxury gained through unrighteousness.

5. **Simple pleasures suffice for the *junzi*.** Confucius enjoyed simple food, water, and using his bent arm as a pillow—and found joy in this.

6. **Friendship is essential to happiness.** Human connection, shared inquiry, and mutual cultivation are central to the flourishing life.

7. **The pursuit of external goods brings anxiety.** Chasing wealth and status creates insecurity; the person dependent on externals cannot be stably happy.

8. **Purpose provides resilience against misfortune.** Commitment to transmitting the Way gave Confucius a sense of mission that sustained him through rejection and failure.

9. **Moral achievement brings satisfaction.** Making genuine progress in cultivation—overcoming faults, developing virtues—is intrinsically rewarding.

10. **Joy is a natural consequence of harmony.** When inner virtue aligns with outer behavior and one's relationships are in order, happiness naturally results.

## 11. HOW TO BE ONESELF WHILE BEING MORAL

1. **Morality completes the self rather than constraining it.** The Way corresponds to what we most truly are; following it fulfills rather than suppresses authentic selfhood.

2. **Ritual expresses genuine feeling in proper form.** *Li* is not external imposition but the appropriate vehicle for emotions one genuinely feels—grief, respect, joy.

3. **Different people embody virtue in distinctive ways.** Confucius's students had different temperaments and expressed virtue differently—there is no single personality type for the *junzi*.

4. **Native endowment varies and should be developed accordingly.** Some are naturally inclined toward courage, others toward learning, others toward kindness—each develops virtue from their starting point.

5. **The goal is to integrate desire and duty, not suppress desire.** At 70, Confucius could follow his heart without transgressing—authentic selfhood and morality had become one.

6. **Self-cultivation is self-creation.** Through practice, one becomes genuinely the sort of person who desires what is right—this is a truer self than untutored impulse.

7. **The petty person is not more authentic than the *junzi*.** Giving in to selfish impulse is not being true to oneself but being enslaved to the least worthy parts of oneself.

8. **Personal style and judgment remain after cultivation.** The *junzi* makes independent judgments about particulars, applying principles creatively rather than mechanically.

9. **Sincerity (*cheng*) requires inner-outer correspondence.** One should be what one appears to be—genuine selfhood means integrity between inner state and outer expression.

10. **Individuality is preserved within a common framework.** All cultivated persons follow the Way, but each does so as a distinctive individual—unity of direction, diversity of expression.

---

## 12. WHETHER ONE CAN BE IMMORAL AND ALSO TRUE TO ONESELF

1. **Immorality is self-betrayal, not self-expression.** To act against *ren* is to violate one's own nature, not to express it.

2. **The petty person (*xiaoren*) is driven by forces he does not control.** Enslaved to appetite, fear, and self-interest, he is not autonomous and therefore not truly himself.

3. **Vice produces inner fragmentation.** The wicked person experiences internal conflict, regret, and anxiety that make psychological integration impossible.

4. **Human nature is oriented toward goodness.** To reject morality is to reject one's own nature—one cannot be true to what one is while denying what one is.

5. **Self-knowledge and moral knowledge are connected.** The person who truly understood himself would understand his moral nature—immorality requires self-deception.

6. **The *junzi* is at ease; the petty person is always distressed.** The wicked lack the inner harmony that constitutes genuine selfhood.

7. **Selfishness defeats the self it serves.** The pursuit of private advantage at the expense of morality ultimately frustrates the agent's own deepest interests.

8. **Virtue is the precondition of autonomy.** Only the cultivated person acts from his own judgment rather than being pushed by external forces—vice is a form of bondage.

9. **There is no stable self to be true to prior to cultivation.** The uncultivated person is a bundle of impulses, not a coherent self; genuine selfhood is an achievement.

10. **Authenticity without morality is incoherent.** Since the self is constituted by its relationships and commitments, betraying one's moral nature means there is no self left to be true to.

---

## 13. SNAPPY APHORISMS (Positions Underlying Them)

1. **The teaching can be summed up: loyalty and reciprocity.** "Is there a single word that can serve as a guide for life? Reciprocity (*shu*)—do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself."

2. **Learning and thinking are both necessary.** "Learning without thinking is useless; thinking without learning is dangerous."

3. **The *junzi* and petty person differ in their concerns.** "The *junzi* understands what is right; the petty person understands what is profitable."

4. **Real knowledge includes knowing the limits of knowledge.** "To know what you know and know what you don't know—that is true knowledge."

5. **Wealth and status are to be evaluated by their source.** "Wealth and rank obtained through immoral means are to me like floating clouds."

6. **Age should bring wisdom and humility.** "At fifteen I set my heart on learning. At thirty I was established. At forty I had no doubts. At fifty I knew the will of Heaven. At sixty my ear was attuned. At seventy I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing."

7. **Words should match actions.** "The *junzi* is ashamed to let his words outrun his deeds."

8. **Correction should be welcomed.** "If I am told of my faults, I am delighted."

9. **Example is more powerful than command.** "If you lead by regulations and keep order with punishments, the people will evade them and have no shame. If you lead by virtue and keep order through ritual, they will have a sense of shame and correct themselves."

10. **Self-cultivation is the foundation.** "Wishing to govern the state, first regulate the family. Wishing to regulate the family, first cultivate the self."
