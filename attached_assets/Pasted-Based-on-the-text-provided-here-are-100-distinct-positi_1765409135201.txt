Based on the text provided, here are **100 distinct positions, concepts, or arguments** presented in the work:

1. Economic behavior is governed by two autonomous rationalities: Smithian and Veblenian.  
2. Smithian rationality is focused on provisioning and efficient resource allocation.  
3. Veblenian rationality is centered on status display and social signaling.  
4. Much apparent economic irrationality is one rationality masquerading as the other.  
5. Economic irrationality can also arise from collisions between Smithian and Veblenian rationalities.  
6. Luxury purchases are rational under Veblenian logic, not Smithian.  
7. Extreme frugality may optimize Smithian goals but harm Veblenian social positioning.  
8. Smithian rationality is the logic of provisioning.  
9. It aims to maximize returns under constraint.  
10. Returns can be nutritional, financial, or instrumental.  
11. The Smithian agent is a problem-solver in a world of limited resources.  
12. Smithian rationality values outcomes over appearances.  
13. It is the mindset of the provider.  
14. A Smithian utility function formalizes provisioning logic.  
15. It maps circumstances and actions to a real number representing “return.”  
16. The agent chooses the action that maximizes this utility.  
17. Smithian models flatten human motivational complexity.  
18. Smithian rationality varies by time horizon, social context, and scale.  
19. It governs everyday decisions like eating, shopping, and time allocation.  
20. It underpins market dynamics and investment strategies.  
21. Short-term Smith rationality favors immediacy and liquidity.  
22. Long-term Smith rationality prioritizes sustainability and compounding.  
23. Institutions (governments, firms, families) are macro expressions of Smithian logic.  
24. Moral commitments can piggyback on Smithian rationality as reputation enhancers.  
25. Smithian rationality is not exhaustive; it does not explain aesthetics, loyalty, or self-sacrifice.  
26. Reductionism—treating all behavior as provisioning—risks collapsing meaningful distinctions.  
27. There may be other rationalities: ethical, epistemic, religious.  
28. Smithian rationality may be one mode among several, activated contextually.  
29. Veblenian rationality is the logic of display.  
30. It governs signaling of reproductive fitness, social dominance, or cultural superiority.  
31. Value in Veblenian logic lies in visibility, costliness, and perceived extravagance.  
32. Waste becomes a feature—it signals resource abundance.  
33. Examples: peacock’s tail, luxury watch, overpriced cocktail, gallery opening.  
34. Veblenian behavior is often mistaken for irrationality in Smithian models.  
35. It is coherent from the standpoint of mate attraction or status consolidation.  
36. A Veblen utility function assigns value based on perceived signaling value.  
37. It maps circumstances and actions to a real number representing signaling worth.  
38. Wastefulness, exclusivity, and hard-to-fake acts score high Veblen utility.  
39. Veblen utility is relational and positional—depends on audience and cultural coding.  
40. It explains luxury consumption, positional goods, and status-seeking.  
41. Veblenian rationality manifests in blatant luxury spending.  
42. It also appears in subtle forms: minimalist architecture, philanthropy, curated social media.  
43. Virtue can be Veblenized when moral stances become status markers.  
44. Displays can be aggressive (bling) or restrained (understated elegance).  
45. All serve reproductive or hierarchical functions: to be seen and to position oneself above others.  
46. Edge case: asceticism as status-through-withdrawal.  
47. Edge case: artists cultivating obscurity to enhance mystique.  
48. Some behaviors signal by denying they are signals (anti-display).  
49. Edge case: compulsive consumption without an audience.  
50. Edge case: status performances that become self-harm.  
51. Signal failure: mimicking elite cues without cultural fluency.  
52. Veblenian efficacy depends on audience recognition, cultural fluency, and timing.  
53. Veblenian rationality extends to art, religion, politics, and self-denial.  
54. Aesthetic choices often double as status markers.  
55. Religious devotion can function as display of costly commitment.  
56. Political affiliation serves as identity performance.  
57. Not all such behavior is reducible to signaling (e.g., private sacrifice).  
58. Veblenian signaling is often gender-asymmetric.  
59. Male signaling emphasizes provisioning/dominance.  
60. Female signaling may emphasize beauty/selectivity/relational leverage.  
61. Misdiagnosis: Behaviors labeled irrational are often Veblen-rational.  
62. Examples: $300 sneakers, influencer lifestyles on credit, artists refusing commercial success.  
63. These are calculated signaling attempts within a social economy.  
64. Traditional models mislabel signaling as wasteful, neurotic, or self-destructive.  
65. Rationality isn’t failing—the model of rationality is too narrow.  
66. Collisions between Smithian and Veblenian rationalities produce genuine irrationality.  
67. Examples: entrepreneur bankrupting for prestige, academic sabotaging research for fashion.  
68. Incoherence arises from trying to satisfy two incompatible systems.  
69. Smith says conserve; Veblen says burn.  
70. The result is behavioral noise: mixed signals and wasted effort.  
71. Such collisions are increasingly common in modern consumer society.  
72. True irrationality is attempting to be two kinds of rational at once.  
73. The economic mind runs on a dual OS: Smithian and Veblenian.  
74. These systems are evolutionarily grounded and cognitively separable.  
75. They are often in conflict.  
76. Context determines which rationality is expressed.  
77. This moves economics beyond rationality vs. irrationality dichotomy.  
78. The dual model reframes behavior by its contextual function.  
79. Implications for consumer choice modeling: must include both provisioning and display.  
80. Implications for policy design: must account for status concerns.  
81. Implications for cultural analysis: explains consumption patterns and fashion cycles.  
82. Implications for self-understanding: explains internal tension between acquiring and displaying.  
83. Most people are not irrational—they are navigating two rationalities.  
84. Economics is incomplete without modeling both systems.  
85. Smithian rationality is the substrate of practical economic decision-making.  
86. Veblenian rationality is the substrate of social and sexual selection dynamics.  
87. The two systems can operate simultaneously within the same individual.  
88. What is efficient in one system may be inefficient in the other.  
89. Status signaling can be a rational investment in social or mating capital.  
90. Display logic often requires waste as proof of resource abundance.  
91. Cultural capital is necessary for successful Veblenian signaling.  
92. Signaling strategies can become maladaptive if social context changes.  
93. Moral and ideological commitments can be co-opted by both rationalities.  
94. Economic models that ignore Veblenian motives will mispredict behavior.  
95. The Dual OS model sees conflict as inherent, not aberrant.  
96. Behavioral economics often mistakes Veblenian behavior for cognitive bias.  
97. Understanding both systems improves prediction in marketing, policy, and finance.  
98. The tension between provisioning and display is a core human dilemma.  
99. Evolutionary psychology supports the separation of these two rationalities.  
100. A complete economic science must model the multi-code human mind.
