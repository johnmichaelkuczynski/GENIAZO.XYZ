FIX INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AGENT: FUNCTION 10 - Economic Interpretation

PROBLEM: The function is performing VOCABULARY TRANSFORMATION (introducing new symbols, rewriting axioms). This is wrong. That's Function 8's job.

WHAT IT SHOULD DO: Find a CONCRETE ECONOMIC MODEL where the axioms are TRUE. A model consists of:
1. A specific DOMAIN (goods, firms, markets, consumers, currencies, etc.)
2. A specific INTERPRETATION of each primitive (what R means in economic terms)
3. VERIFICATION that each axiom holds under this interpretation

RULE: NEVER introduce new symbols. NEVER rewrite axioms. KEEP the original primitives. FIND an economic domain where they are true.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

∀x ( R(x,x) )
∀x∀y ( R(x,y) → R(y,x) )
∀x∀y∀z ( (R(x,y) ∧ R(y,z)) → R(x,z) )

CORRECT OUTPUT:

DOMAIN: Goods in a market
INTERPRETATION: R(x,y) holds iff x and y are in the same price bracket.

VERIFICATION:
- Axiom 1 (Reflexivity): Every good is in the same price bracket as itself. ✓
- Axiom 2 (Symmetry): If x is in the same bracket as y, then y is in the same bracket as x. ✓
- Axiom 3 (Transitivity): Same-bracket relation is transitive. ✓

EXAMPLE: R(bread, milk) is true if both cost $3-5; R(bread, caviar) is false.

ALTERNATE CORRECT OUTPUT:

DOMAIN: Companies on a stock exchange
INTERPRETATION: R(x,y) holds iff x and y are in the same industry sector.

VERIFICATION:
- Axiom 1: Every company is in the same sector as itself. ✓
- Axiom 2: If x is same sector as y, then y is same sector as x. ✓
- Axiom 3: Same-sector relation is transitive. ✓

EXAMPLE: R(Apple, Microsoft) is true (both tech); R(Apple, ExxonMobil) is false.

ANOTHER ALTERNATE:

DOMAIN: Consumers in a market
INTERPRETATION: R(x,y) holds iff x and y have the same income quintile.

VERIFICATION:
- Axiom 1: Every consumer is in the same quintile as themselves. ✓
- Axiom 2: If x is same quintile as y, then y is same quintile as x. ✓
- Axiom 3: Same-quintile is transitive. ✓

EXAMPLE: R(Alice, Bob) is true if both earn $50k-75k annually.

KEY DISTINCTION:

WRONG (vocabulary transformation):

LANGUAGE: {S(x,y)}
DEFINITIONS: R(x,y) ↔ S(x,y)
AXIOMS: ∀x S(x,x) ...

RIGHT (model finding):

DOMAIN: [concrete economic entities]
INTERPRETATION: R(x,y) means [specific economic relation]
VERIFICATION: [check each axiom holds]
