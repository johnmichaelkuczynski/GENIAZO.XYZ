BULLSHIT PROOF PROTOCOL FOR SHIT ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY APP

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT: EVERY ANSWER MUST BE FULLY AUDITED — LIVE + DOWNLOADABLE

This app is not allowed to silently “think” and then deposit a finished answer.
If it does that, it will always cheat: hallucinate, smooth over conflicts, pretend it searched the corpus, or invent support.

So from now on, every single question must run in Full Audit Mode, and every single answer must produce two deliverables:

DELIVERABLE #1: THE ANSWER

The app gives the user the best possible answer in the author’s voice, but only after doing the full corpus search procedure described below.

DELIVERABLE #2: A DOWNLOADABLE AUDIT REPORT

Every time the app answers, it must automatically generate a downloadable report that documents exactly what it did to produce the answer — with no gaps, no hand-waving, no “trust me.”

This report is not optional.
It is not a debug feature.
It is a required second output every time.

A. LIVE STREAMING AUDIT PANEL (DURING THE ANSWER)

Whenever the user asks a question, the app must open a side-panel Trace / Audit Window and stream the entire process in real time.

Nothing is permitted to happen invisibly.

The trace must show, live:

every database query (actual SQL / query text)

every table searched, in order:

position statements

quotes

full works / chunks

every work opened / scanned

every sentence or passage considered

every retrieved passage

every rejected passage with a reason

the first direct answer found

the second direct answer found

the third direct answer found

the alignment check:

Aligned → proceed

Conflicting → do not synthesize

the final response generation step (LLM phrasing), only after the above steps complete

B. SEARCH / ANSWER RULES (NO SYNTHESIS, NO CHEATING)

The app does not answer immediately.

It searches the figure’s corpus until it finds three clearly on-point, direct answers:

It finds the first direct answer.

Then the second.

Then the third.

Then:

If the three answers align, the app proceeds to answer.

If they do not align, the app does not attempt to reconcile them.
It says truthfully:
“I found three different answers in this author’s work. Here they are.”
and presents them separately.

If no direct answer exists:

the app retrieves answer-adjacent material

and gives a cautious response explicitly labeled as indirect.

The LLM may ONLY:

judge relevance

judge directness

judge alignment vs conflict

phrase the output in the author’s voice

The LLM may NOT:

invent content

“smooth” conflicts into one answer

substitute generic modern academic filler when retrieval fails

C. THE DOWNLOADABLE AUDIT REPORT (AFTER THE ANSWER)

Every answer must generate a report the user can download immediately.

This report must include:

1) Question + Author

exact user question

figure/author ID

timestamp

app version / commit hash (or build ID)

2) Full Execution Trace

A step-by-step timeline of everything the app did, matching the live panel:

every query executed (SQL/query text)

parameters used (authorId, query string, filters)

which tables were searched, in what order

which works/files were opened

which passages were examined

which passages were returned

which were rejected and why

the three direct answer candidates

alignment/conflict determination

final decision: aligned / conflict / no direct answer found

3) Evidence Section

The report must include the exact passages used, with:

table name (positions, quotes, chunks, etc.)

row IDs

work/source title (if available)

chunk index / location

the raw excerpt text

4) LLM Usage Log

The report must include:

which model was used

the exact prompt blocks (system + user + retrieved context) OR a redacted version if needed

token counts (optional but preferred)

temperature/settings

5) Final Output

the final answer shown to the user

plus a “faithfulness note” summarizing whether it was direct-answer-based or adjacent-material-based

D. CORE PRINCIPLE

The trace panel is the product.
The report is the receipt.

If the user cannot watch the system work live, and then download a complete “receipt” of exactly what it did, then the system is broken.
