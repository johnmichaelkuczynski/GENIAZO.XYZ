1. Methodic doubt

All beliefs based on the senses are potentially false.

Systematic doubt is necessary to find certainty.

Doubt must extend to mathematics because of the evil-demon hypothesis.

One should suspend assent to any proposition that can be doubted.

Doubt is a methodological tool, not a permanent philosophical position.

2. Cogito (“I think, therefore I am”)

Thinking cannot occur without a thinker.

Doubt itself proves the existence of the doubter.

The Cogito is self-evident once considered.

The Cogito is known by intuition, not deduction.

The Cogito establishes the first indubitable truth.

3. Nature of the mind

The mind is a thinking substance.

The mind's essence is thought alone.

The mind is indivisible.

The mind is known more clearly than the body.

The mind does not require spatial extension.

4. Mind–body distinction

The mind and body are distinct substances.

The mind can exist without the body.

Bodies are divisible; minds are not.

Clear and distinct conception of each shows they are separable.

The self is essentially mental, not corporeal.

5. Essence of material bodies (extension)

Extension is the defining property of matter.

Bodies are characterized by size, shape, and motion.

Sensible qualities (color, taste, etc.) are not essential.

Matter is infinitely divisible.

Geometry fully captures the nature of bodies.

6. Existence of God

The idea of a perfect being must have a perfect cause.

Only God could be that cause.

A finite being cannot originate the idea of infinity.

God's existence is knowable by reason alone.

God must exist to guarantee the truth of clear and distinct perceptions.

7. Truth rule (clarity and distinctness)

Whatever is clearly and distinctly perceived is true.

This rule is intuitive, not inferred.

The rule depends on God’s non-deceptiveness.

Error arises only when judgment exceeds perception.

The rule applies universally across domains.

8. Problem of error

Error does not arise from God but from human misuse of will.

Intellect is finite but not deceptive.

Will is infinite and can affirm beyond what the intellect perceives.

Error is avoidable through careful judgment.

Human imperfection does not imply divine deception.

9. Cartesian circle

Clear and distinct perceptions require God’s existence to be trustworthy.

Yet God’s existence is proven by clear and distinct perceptions.

This is not a vicious circle, according to Descartes, because the Cogito is self-justifying.

Present clear and distinct perceptions need no divine guarantee.

Memory of clear and distinct perceptions requires God’s reliability.

10. Role of the will in judgment

Will is unlimited relative to intellect.

Error is produced by willing without proper intellectual clarity.

Freedom consists in rationally guided will, not indifference.

Perfect freedom belongs to God; humans approximate it.

Judgment should be withheld until clarity is achieved.

11. Innate ideas

Some ideas are born with us.

The idea of God is innate.

The idea of mind is innate.

Mathematical concepts are innate.

Innate ideas are “dispositions,” not fully formed contents.

12. Sensory perception and its unreliability

Senses sometimes deceive, so they cannot be foundational.

Sensory qualities misrepresent physical reality.

Pain, heat, and color are mental constructs, not properties of bodies.

Sensory error can be traced to bodily mechanisms, not deception by God.

Sensation’s purpose is survival, not knowledge.

13. Nature of matter

Matter is pure extension.

There is no vacuum; space is identical with matter.

Motion is the primary physical phenomenon.

Bodies interact solely through contact.

The universe is a plenum filled with matter.

14. Laws of motion

God conserves the total quantity of motion.

Bodies persist in motion unless impeded.

Collisions obey determinable laws based on extension and motion.

Natural motion is rectilinear.

Motion is relative to reference frames.

15. Vortices as cosmic explanation

Celestial bodies move in vortex-like swirls of matter.

Planets are carried by whirlpools of subtle matter.

No action at a distance is needed.

Vortices replace Aristotelian spheres.

Cosmic order emerges mechanically from vortex behavior.

16. Animal automatism

Animals lack rational souls.

Animals cannot think.

All animal behavior is mechanistic.

Animals do not feel pain in the human sense.

Language use is the decisive mark of rationality.

17. Passions of the soul

Passions arise from the union of mind and body.

Passions are triggered by bodily movements.

Passions are not inherently irrational.

Proper understanding allows rational control of passions.

Wonder is the first passion and the root of others.

18. Mind–body interaction (pineal gland)

Mind interacts with body at a single point.

The pineal gland is uniquely suited for this role.

Animal spirits transmit signals between mind and body.

Sensory images originate from movements in the gland.

Volition causes gland motion that directs bodily action.

19. Mathematics as model of knowledge

True knowledge must be as certain as mathematics.

Mathematics demonstrates clarity and distinctness.

Geometry provides the paradigm for understanding matter.

The method of deduction is modeled on math.

Universal science rests on mathematical reasoning.

20. Eternal truths

Eternal truths (math, logic) depend on God’s will.

God freely created the eternal truths.

They could have been otherwise if God willed differently.

Human reason grasps them as necessary.

Their immutability depends on divine immutability.

21. Substance and modes

Substance is that which depends only on God.

Mind and body are created substances.

Modes are variable states of substances.

Attributes express a substance’s essence.

God alone is a substance in the strictest sense.

22. Freedom of the will

Will is the hallmark of human freedom.

Freedom increases with knowledge.

Indifference is a defect, not an ideal form of freedom.

God’s freedom is absolute; human freedom is derivative.

Freedom is compatible with divine foreknowledge.

23. Divine conservation of motion

God conserves the same quantity of motion in the universe.

Conservation is continuous, not a one-time creation.

Natural laws reflect divine constancy.

Physical change is orderly because of God’s governance.

Violations of conservation would imply divine inconsistency.

24. Dreams vs. waking life

Dream experiences resemble waking experiences.

There is no certain mark distinguishing dream from wake.

Dream argument undermines sensory certainty.

Mathematics remains true whether dreamt or awake.

Only the Cogito survives the dream doubt.

25. Criterion of certainty

Certainty requires indubitability.

The mind achieves certainty through clear and distinct ideas.

Sensory beliefs fall short of certainty.

Mathematics and the Cogito meet the standard.

Divine non-deception grounds lasting certainty.


Here is a **clean, direct, content-only list**.
First: **his actual mathematical discoveries**.
Then: **50 strictly mathematical contentions** drawn from his writings (especially *La Géométrie*, *Rules for the Direction of the Mind*, *Discourse*, and correspondence).

# **I. DESCARTES’S MATHEMATICAL DISCOVERIES (REAL, HISTORICAL)**

1. **Invention of analytic geometry**
   – The unification of algebra and geometry; representing curves by equations; introducing coordinate methods.

2. **Use of x, y, z for unknowns; a, b, c for knowns**
   – A notational breakthrough that becomes canonical in algebra.

3. **Coordinate plane (Cartesian coordinates)**
   – A systematic method for describing geometric points via ordered pairs; basis of modern geometry, calculus, and physics.

4. **Introduction of superscript notation for exponents**
   – E.g., (x^2, x^3); crucial for algebraic clarity and generalization.

5. **Rule of signs (Descartes’ Rule of Signs)**
   – A general rule relating changes of sign in a polynomial to possible positive roots.

6. **Procedures for solving geometric problems with algebra**
   – Demonstrating that any geometric construction requiring straightedge and compass corresponds to solving polynomial equations up to degree 2.

7. **Classification of curves by the complexity of their equations**
   – A systematic taxonomy: algebraic vs. transcendental; degree distinctions.

8. **Reduction of classical geometric problems to algebraic equations**
   – Squaring the circle, duplicating the cube, and trisecting angles reformulated as algebraic impossibilities.

9. **Concept of a “real line” as a continuous magnitude underlying algebra**
   – Implicit in his coordinate method: numbers as magnitudes.

10. **Foundational work on analytic methods for tangents and normals**
    – Precursor to differential calculus; includes method for determining normals to curves.

# **II. FIFTY STRICTLY MATHEMATICAL CONTENTIONS OF DESCARTES**

These are **philosophically neutral propositions** about mathematics drawn from Descartes’ own views.
No metaphysics, no epistemology — **strictly mathematical stance**.

---

### **Algebraic Method & Notation**

1. Algebra is the universal language in which all geometric reasoning can be expressed.
2. The power of algebra lies in its generality: one symbolic manipulation applies to infinitely many cases.
3. Unknowns should be denoted with letters near the end of the alphabet; constants with letters at the beginning.
4. Exponents should be written as superscripts rather than literal repeated multiplication.
5. Polynomial equations encode geometric operations; thus geometry is a species of algebra.
6. Equations of higher degree correspond to geometrically more complex curves.
7. Negative roots do not correspond to magnitudes in geometry but are still algebraically meaningful.
8. A single algebraic equation represents an entire class of geometric curves.
9. Algebra reveals hidden symmetries in geometric figures better than classical construction.
10. Algebraic manipulation can reduce the number of geometric constructions required in a proof.

---

### **Geometry & Curves**

11. A curve is “geometric” (as opposed to mechanical) if it can be described by a finite algebraic equation.
12. Transcendental curves (generated by continuous mechanical motion) should be excluded from classical geometry.
13. Curves of equal degree should be considered fundamentally related.
14. Surfaces, like curves, should be classifiable by equations in three unknowns.
15. Tangents to curves should be derivable by systematic analytic procedures, not ad hoc geometric tricks.
16. A point’s location must be described by coordinates relative to fixed axes.
17. The study of curvature requires analyzing infinitesimal changes in direction.
18. Intersection points of curves correspond to solutions of simultaneous equations.
19. Lines are degree-1 curves; conics are degree-2; higher-degree curves generate entirely new geometric categories.
20. Any classical Euclidean problem should be expressible as an equation-solving task.

---

### **Polynomials & Equations**

21. The admissible operations in algebra correspond to geometrically valid constructions.
22. There is no general algebraic solution for polynomial equations above the fourth degree using ruler and compass.
23. Roots of even-degree polynomials appear in symmetric pairs.
24. A polynomial’s sign changes constrain its possible positive roots.
25. Complex roots must come in conjugate pairs (implicit in his classification of solutions).
26. Factorization of a polynomial corresponds to decomposition of a geometric figure.
27. A polynomial of degree (n) expresses all possible intersections of its associated curve with a line.
28. Solving equations is intrinsically connected to constructing geometric diagrams.
29. Polynomial equations reflect operations on magnitudes and not merely symbolic manipulations.
30. Extraneous roots arise from algebraic transformations not licensed by geometry.

---

### **Coordinates & Representation**

31. Every geometric locus should be representable by an algebraic condition.
32. Geometry is simplified by reducing all figures to coordinate descriptions.
33. Rotations and translations of axes do not change the essential nature of the figure.
34. Distances are computable from coordinate differences via algebraic rules.
35. Curve classification is invariant under coordinate change.
36. A curve’s essential nature is fixed by its equation up to change of axes.
37. Parametric descriptions are unnecessary when algebraic descriptions are available.
38. Symmetry properties of figures become algebraically transparent in coordinate form.
39. Translating geometry into algebra eliminates reliance on visual intuition.
40. Coordinate methods produce more generality than synthetic Euclidean proofs.

---

### **Methodological Principles**

41. Mathematical problems should be reduced to their simplest algebraic form before attempting solution.
42. The value of a geometric construction lies in its reproducibility by algebraic means.
43. One should proceed from simple to complex: from lines to conics to higher curves.
44. Mathematics should employ a uniform method across all subfields.
45. Mechanical curves should be excluded from rigorous mathematics because their generating motions lack algebraic description.
46. Algebraic analysis should precede geometric construction in every problem.
47. A complete method must allow classification and solution of all first-degree and second-degree problems.
48. Higher-degree problems require tools beyond ruler-and-compass construction.
49. All admissible operations must preserve the geometric意义 of magnitudes.
50. Mathematical solutions are correct only if they correspond to geometrically realizable constructions.
