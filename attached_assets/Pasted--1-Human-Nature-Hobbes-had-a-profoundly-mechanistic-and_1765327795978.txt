### **1. Human Nature**
Hobbes had a profoundly mechanistic and pessimistic view of human psychology.
1. **Mechanistic Motivation:** Humans are complex machines driven by "appetites" (desires) and "aversions," with the fundamental goal of seeking pleasure and avoiding pain.
2. **Natural Equality:** In the state of nature, humans are roughly equal in physical and mental capacities, such that even the weakest can kill the strongest through cunning or alliance.
3. **The Primacy of the "Right of Nature":** Every individual has a natural right (*jus naturale*) to use any means, including violence, to preserve their own life. This right is boundless in the absence of authority.
4. **Perpetual Desire for Power:** Human life is characterized by a "perpetual and restless desire of Power after power, that ceaseth only in Death." This is driven by competition, diffidence (fear), and the desire for glory.

### **2. The State of Nature**
This is the hypothetical condition of humanity without any political authority.
1. **Condition of War:** The state of nature is a "war of every man against every man." It is not constant fighting, but a constant *threat* and readiness for violence, making life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
2. **No Justice or Injustice:** In this state, there is "no mine and thine distinct," and consequently, "the notions of Right and Wrong, Justice and Injustice have there no place." These concepts require an established sovereign power to define and enforce laws.
3. **Rational Fear of Death:** The war of all against all is not desirable; it is the rational fear of violent death that becomes the primary motivator for humans to seek peace and leave the state of nature.
4. **Right to All Things:** Because there is no security, every person has a right to everything, including to another's body. This universal right renders all claims ineffective and life perpetually insecure.

### **3. The Social Contract**
The process by which individuals escape the state of nature.
1. **Covenant of Every Man with Every Man:** Individuals mutually agree to simultaneously renounce their natural right to all things and transfer these rights to a sovereign. It is **not** a contract between subjects and sovereign, but among the subjects themselves.
2. **Authorization and Representation:** The multitude authorizes a sovereign (one man or assembly) to act on their behalf. The sovereign's actions are considered the actions of the subjects, who are the authors. This makes the sovereign’s power absolute and legitimate.
3. **Irrevocable:** The covenant is permanent. To return to the state of nature or rebel is irrational and a violation of the contract that authorized the sovereign to act for their preservation.
4. **Founded on Fear, Not Trust:** The contract is made possible by the mutual fear individuals have of each other in the state of nature. Its enforcement does not rely on trust, but on the coercive power of the sovereign they create.

### **4. Sovereignty and the Leviathan**
The nature and power of the commonwealth (the "Leviathan").
1. **Absolute and Indivisible:** Sovereign power must be absolute, unlimited, and indivisible. Dividing power (e.g., between king, lords, and commons) recreates the conditions of war within the state.
2. **Source of Law and Morality:** The sovereign is the sole legislator. Law is the command of the sovereign, and justice is obeying that law. The sovereign defines property, rights, and good and evil for civil society.
3. **Not Subject to Civil Law:** Because the sovereign creates civil law, it cannot be bound by it. To punish or depose the sovereign is to return to the state of nature. Subjects must obey the sovereign’s commands, except the direct order to kill or maim themselves (as the right to self-preservation is inalienable).
4. **Responsibility for Peace and Defense:** The sovereign's primary function is to ensure the common defense and maintain peace. While its power is absolute, its *purpose* is the safety and contentment of the people. A sovereign who fails to provide security has failed in its fundamental duty.

Of course. Below are five contentions from Thomas Hobbes’s philosophy, primarily drawn from *Leviathan* (1651), for each of the specified topics.

---

### **1. THE BASIS OF STATE LEGITIMACY/ILLEGITIMACY**
1. **Legitimacy derives solely from effective power to protect subjects.** A state is legitimate not by divine right or tradition, but because it can enforce peace and provide security from the violent "state of nature."
2. **Legitimacy is grounded in the authorization of the sovereign by the people.** The sovereign’s right to rule comes from the subjects' mutual covenant (real or hypothetical), where they authorize all his actions.
3. **Illegitimacy arises from failure to provide protection.** The subject’s obligation to obey ceases if the sovereign utterly fails in the primary duty of defense and preservation of life ("the end of obedience is protection").
4. **There is no right to rebel based on perceived injustice.** Since subjects authorize all sovereign acts, they cannot accuse the sovereign of injustice. Rebellion is always illegitimate as it destroys the condition of peace.
5. **Legitimacy is indivisible; divided sovereignty (e.g., between King and Parliament) is a path to civil war and is effectively illegitimate.** Sovereignty must be absolute and unified to be effective.

### **2. THE EXISTENCE AND BASIS OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT**
1. **It is a necessary hypothetical construct, not a historical event.** The social contract is a logical deduction of what rational individuals *must* have agreed to in order to escape the horrors of the state of nature.
2. **Its basis is mutual fear and the desire for self-preservation.** The driving force is not natural sociability but the rational fear of violent death and the "passions that incline men to peace."
3. **It involves the mutual transference of natural rights.** Each individual gives up the right to govern themselves and to all things, transferring this right to a sovereign.
4. **It creates an artificial person (the Leviathan).** The contract is between individuals, not between individuals and the sovereign. The sovereign is the product of the contract, not a party to it.
5. **It is irrevocable.** To avoid a return to the state of nature, the covenant that establishes the commonwealth must be perpetual. Subjects cannot lawfully change the form of government.

### **3. THE NATURE OF REASON**
1. **Reason is computational, not intuitive.** It is "reckoning" (i.e., addition and subtraction) of the consequences of names and definitions. It is a careful, logical deduction.
2. **It is instrumental, not a source of moral truth.** Reason serves the passions by calculating the best means to achieve desired ends (primarily self-preservation).
3. **It is fallible and scarce.** True reason is difficult, and men often misuse it through pride or faulty logic. It is not a universal human constant.
4. **Its core deliverable is the "laws of nature."** Reason discovers precepts (like seeking peace, laying down rights) that are general rules for self-preservation.
5. **It requires clear, agreed-upon definitions.** Dispute and absurdity arise from "insignificant speech"—using words without fixed, clear meanings. Science and peace depend on linguistic precision.

### **4. THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS**
1. **Passions are the fundamental motives of all human action.** "Voluntary motions" have their beginning in "endeavour," which is caused by appetite (desire) or aversion.
2. **The master passion is fear of violent death.** This aversion is the primary psychological basis for leaving the state of nature and the foundation of civil society.
3. **There is no *summum bonum* (ultimate good), only a perpetual *summum malum* (ultimate evil).** Human desire is a constant succession of passions, ceasing only in death. The worst evil is death, which ends all possibility of satisfying desire.
4. **Vanity/vainglory is a destructive passion.** The irrational overestimation of one's own worth leads to conflict and undermines the equality and fear necessary for covenant.
5. **Passions are universal but vary in object and strength.** All humans share a common psychology of passions, but individual desires differ based on experience and constitution.

### **5. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE AND ANIMALS**
1. **Humans have restless curiosity and the capacity for science.** Animals learn from experience, but only humans seek causes and use method to build a system of knowledge.
2. **Human competition is anticipatory and based on glory.** Animals fight for resources or mating, but humans fight for future gain, safety, and reputation, making conflict more pervasive.
3. **Humans use language rationally and deceptively.** Animals may communicate, but only humans use speech to reason, lie, magnify grievances, and represent the unreal.
4. **Humans perceive themselves as unequal, leading to conflict.** Animals accept natural equality in strength. Humans, due to pride and reason, believe they are wiser or better, fueling quarrel.
5. **Only humans can create artificial persons and covenants.** The commonwealth is an artificial creation of human reason and agreement, something impossible for animals.

### **6. MAN'S MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT HIMSELF**
1. **He believes he is more wise or excellent than others (vainglory).** This false pride is a primary cause of discord.
2. **He believes his private judgment is a valid standard for good and evil.** In the state of nature, this is true, but in society, it leads to sedition if not surrendered to the sovereign's judgment.
3. **He believes freedom means absence of all impediments, not just external ones.** True civil liberty is silence of the law, not doing whatever one desires without consequence.
4. **He believes that religious visions or "private revelation" trump public reason and law.** This leads to fanaticism and civil disobedience.
5. **He believes he can retain a right against the sovereign (e.g., to property).** He fails to see that all rights and property are defined and granted by the sovereign's laws, not natural.

### **7. HOW MAN'S MISCONCEPTIONS ADVERSELY AFFECT STATE FORMATION**
1. **Vainglory prevents acknowledgment of equality,** making the mutual trust required for the social contract difficult to achieve.
2. **Insistence on private judgment** leads to disputes over justice and injustice, undermining the sovereign's role as sole arbiter.
3. **The desire for liberty as license** causes men to chafe under necessary laws, viewing them as oppression rather than the price of peace.
4. **Claims to absolute property rights** hinder the sovereign's ability to tax and provide for common defense, a key state function.
5. **Religious dogmatism and claims to private revelation** create factions and "a kingdom within a kingdom," directly challenging sovereign authority and causing civil war.

### **8. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GENDERS**
1. **In the state of nature, dominion over children belongs to the mother,** as paternity is uncertain and she initially has sole power to preserve or expose the infant.
2. **Matrimonial contracts are determined by civil law, not nature.** In the commonwealth, the sovereign decides the terms of marriage (e.g., monogamy), as these affect inheritance and social order.
3. **The family is a small-scale dominion, not a natural unit of affection.** It arises from contract (between parents) and force (over children). The male typically becomes the domestic sovereign by compact or conquest.
4. **Gender relations are, outside civil law, a matter of power and contract.** There is no natural patriarchal authority; it is established by agreement or victory in conflict.
5. **Women can be sovereigns.** Hobbes explicitly states a sovereign can be a woman or an assembly; authority is artificial, not tied to natural male strength.

### **9. RELATIONS BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN**
1. **Parental power is based on the child's consent, explicit or tacit.** The child obeys the parent for preservation, implicitly covenanting for care.
2. **It is originally maternal power.** In nature, the mother has absolute dominion unless she abandons it or the father subdues her by contract.
3. **In a commonwealth, the domestic sovereign (father or mother) represents the household.** The parent's authority within the home is derived from and subject to the civil sovereign.
4. **Children are not born in "full" equality.** They are born in a state of natural weakness and obligation to those who preserve them.
5. **The end of education is to make children fit subjects.** Education should instill obedience to the sovereign and understanding of their true interest in maintaining the commonwealth.

### **10. RELATIONS BETWEEN FRIENDS**
1. **Friendship is a form of contract for mutual utility.** It is based on the agreed exchange of benefits, good will, or society, not on disinterested affection.
2. **It is fragile in the state of nature.** Without a common power to enforce agreements, friendship (like all covenants) is only valid where there is fear of performance from the other party.
3. **In civil society, it flourishes under the umbrella of security.** The sovereign's laws allow trust and cooperation to develop without constant fear of betrayal.
4. **Companionship is a natural desire,** but it is subordinate to the desire for safety. Men seek society for "honour and advantage," not by a natural appetite for others *per se*.
5. **The greatest "friend" is the sovereign,** as it provides the ultimate utility: peace and protection. Loyalty to the state supersedes private friendships that threaten the public peace.

### **11. PUNISHMENT**
1. **Punishment is an evil inflicted by public authority** on a subject who has broken the law.
2. **It cannot be inflicted on the innocent,** as that is not punishment but an act of hostility.
3. **It must be for the end of *correction* of the offender or *example* to others.** Its purpose is to reform the criminal and deter future breaches.
4. **Private revenge is not punishment;** it is a return to the state of nature and is unlawful.
5. **Severity should be calibrated** to make the crime appear a worse bargain than obedience, but excessive cruelty is counterproductive.

### **12. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR PUNISHMENT**
1. **Its ultimate justification is the preservation of the commonwealth.** It upholds the laws that are the "sinews" of the state.
2. **It is justified by the original authorization of the sovereign by the subjects.** By the social contract, subjects authorized the sovereign to do anything necessary for peace, including punish.
3. **It deters future crimes,** thereby securing the primary good of peace.
4. **It channels vengeance into public justice,** preventing private feuds that destroy society.
5. **The criminal, by his own voluntary breach of law, has consented to his punishment.** He authored the sovereign's actions, including his own correction.

### **13. CONSTITUTIONS**
1. **A "constitution" is simply the specific form of sovereign authority established.** It refers to whether sovereignty resides in one man (monarchy), an assembly (aristocracy/democracy), or is divided (a flawed model).
2. **The US-style written constitution as a higher law limiting government would be anathema to Hobbes.** Sovereign power cannot be bound by a prior document; it must be absolute and undivided.
3. **Laws governing succession are vital parts of a constitution.** The greatest threat to a commonwealth is uncertainty about who holds sovereign power.
4. **A "mixed constitution" (like Polybius's praise of Rome) is a recipe for conflict.** Dividing sovereignty between branches leads to "the diseases of a Commonwealth" and civil war.
5. **The only true constitutional question is: where does the final, indivisible authority to judge and enforce reside?** For Hobbes, it must be in a single, determinate locus.

### **14. LAWS (WHAT THEY ARE)**
1. **Law is the command of the sovereign,** not counsel or advice. It is distinguished by its source (the sovereign) and its enforceability.
2. **It is made for the good of the people, but that good is defined by the sovereign, not the people.** The sovereign's command *defines* what is just and for the public benefit.
3. **It is essentially coercive.** It works not by persuasion but by attaching a known penalty to a forbidden action.
4. **Civil Law is the only law that truly obliges in society.** Natural law becomes binding only when commanded by the sovereign. Divine law and customary law are subordinate to civil law.
5. **Law must be promulgated and knowable.** Ignorance of the law may sometimes excuse, but it is the sovereign's duty to make laws clear.

### **15. LAWS (WHEN THEY ARE LEGITIMATE)**
1. **They are legitimate when issued by a legitimate sovereign** (i.e., one established by covenant and capable of protection).
2. **They must be directed to those who have consented to the covenant** (i.e., subjects, not enemies).
3. **They must be for a conceivable benefit to the commonwealth,** even if subjects disagree with the utility. A law ordering self-harm would be void.
4. **They must be applied generally, not as a *bill of attainder* against a specific person without trial.**
5. **They are not rendered illegitimate by being unwise or harsh.** Legitimacy stems from authority, not content, provided the sovereign maintains protection.

### **16. ECONOMICS**
1. **The sovereign's power determines the wealth of the nation.** Prosperity depends on internal peace and defense against external enemies.
2. **Private property is created and guaranteed by the sovereign's laws.** In the state of nature, there is no *mine* and *thine*, only possession.
3. **Taxation is necessary for defense and should be equitable,** based on consumption rather than wealth, to discourage complaint and encourage industry.
4. **The sovereign must regulate trade and commodities as needed for the common good,** including incentivizing population growth and essential trades.
5. **Excessive accumulation by subjects can be dangerous to public peace** and may be regulated, as economic power can challenge sovereign power.

### **17. THE NATURE OF SOVEREIGNTY**
1. **It is absolute and indivisible.** To divide it (e.g., into separate executive, legislative, judicial branches) is to create a "ghost" that will tear the commonwealth apart.
2. **It is artificial and representative.** The sovereign is an "artificial person" who bears the person of all subjects and acts in their name.
3. **It is established by institution (covenant) or acquisition (conquest).** Both forms derive legitimacy from the consent (forced or free) of the governed for the sake of protection.
4. **The sovereign's rights cannot be forfeited or limited.** He holds the right to judge doctrines, make laws, adjudicate disputes, make war and peace, choose ministers, reward and punish.
5. **The sovereign is above the law.** He makes the law and is not subject to it, for to be subject to civil law would require a superior judge, which negates sovereignty.

### **18. THE NATURE OF ANCIENT POLITIES (E.G., ROME, GREECE)**
1. **They were fundamentally unstable and disordered.** Their histories are largely records of sedition, faction, and civil war because they never properly understood undivided sovereignty.
2. **They confused liberty with the right to participate in government,** rather than understanding liberty as the "silence of the law." This led to democratic anarchy.
3. **Their political philosophy (especially Aristotle's) was pernicious.** It taught men to call monarchy "tyranny" and democracy "liberty," filling them with seditious ideas.
4. **They allowed private citizens to maintain armies** (like Roman generals) or powerful factions (like Greek demagogues), which inevitably turned against the state.
5. **They mixed religion with politics incorrectly,** allowing priests or oracles to challenge civil authority, creating a "kingdom of darkness" within the state.
