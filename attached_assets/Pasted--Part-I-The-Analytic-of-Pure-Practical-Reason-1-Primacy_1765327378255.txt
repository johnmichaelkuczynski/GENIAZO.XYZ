**Part I: The Analytic of Pure Practical Reason**
1.  **Primacy of Practical Reason:** Pure practical reason has primacy over speculative reason because it can determine the will and postulate objects (God, freedom, immortality) that speculative reason can only think but not know.
2.  **The Moral Law as a Fact of Reason (*Factum der Vernunft*):** The fundamental principle of morality is given a priori as an unconditional, apodictically certain fact of pure reason, not derived from experience. Consciousness of this law is undeniable.
3.  **The Supreme Principle: The Categorical Imperative (as formulated here):** "So act that the maxim of your will could always hold at the same time as a principle in a giving of universal law."
4.  **Freedom as the *Ratio Essendi* of the Moral Law:** Freedom (in the positive sense of autonomy) is the necessary condition (*ratio essendi*) for the existence of the moral law. Without a free will, morality is impossible.
5.  **The Moral Law as the *Ratio Cognoscendi* of Freedom:** The moral law is how we become *aware* of our freedom (*ratio cognoscendi*). We know we are free because we are conscious of being bound by the moral law.
6.  **Practical Freedom is Real:** While theoretical reason cannot prove freedom, practical reason necessitates its reality as a postulate for morality.
7.  **The Object of Pure Practical Reason is the Good and the Evil:** These are defined strictly in relation to the moral law, not antecedent to it. The good is what is necessitated by the moral law; evil is what is forbidden by it.
8.  **The Moral Law is a Formal Principle:** It is a law of the form of maxims (their universality), not a law dictating specific ends or content.
9.  **The "Typic of Pure Practical Judgment":** To apply the moral law to natural actions, we use the *understanding's* concept of a "law of nature" as a type or schema. We ask: "Could your maxim be a universal law of nature?"
10. **Motivation (*Triebfeder*) of Pure Practical Reason:** The sole legitimate incentive for moral action is *respect (Achtung)* for the moral law—a feeling caused by reason itself, not a pathological (empirical) feeling.
11. **Respect humiliates our self-conceit (*Eigendünkel*):** It strikes down the pretensions of our sensible inclinations to be the primary determining ground of the will.
12. **The *Summum Bonum* (Highest Good) is the Necessary Ultimate Object:** The complete good is constituted by **virtue (worthiness to be happy)** combined with **happiness proportionate to that virtue.**
13. **Virtue is the Supreme Good (*supremum bonum*):** It is the unconditioned condition of the *summum bonum*. However, it is not the *complete* good.
14. **The Antinomy of Practical Reason:** There is an apparent contradiction between the pursuit of virtue and the pursuit of happiness, as they are not causally connected in the world of sense.
15. **Solution to the Antinomy:** The *summum bonum* is possible only if we postulate (1) **the immortality of the soul** (for endless progress toward perfect virtue/holiness) and (2) **the existence of God** (as an intelligent cause of nature who can harmonize virtue and happiness).

**Part II: The Dialectic of Pure Practical Reason**
16. **Postulates of Pure Practical Reason:** These are God, freedom, and immortality—theoretical propositions not provable by speculative reason but necessitated as practically necessary presuppositions of obeying the moral law.
17. **Immortality is Postulated:** Moral perfection (holiness) is required by the law but is unattainable for a finite being in existence. Hence, we must postulate an endless temporal progression (immortality) to make the demand rational.
18. **God is Postulated:** A necessary being with supreme causality must be postulated as the ground of the exact correspondence between virtue and happiness in the *summum bonum*, which is not achievable in nature as we know it.
19. **Moral Faith (*Glaube*):** Belief in God and immortality is a matter of pure rational *faith*, grounded in practical necessity, not theoretical demonstration or empirical evidence.
20. **The Moral Proof of God's Existence:** Not a theoretical proof, but a demonstration that belief in God is a necessary condition for coherently willing the final end (*summum bonum*) dictated by the moral law.
21. **The Practical Extension of Reason:** Through its postulates, practical reason gives objective (though only practical) reality to ideas that for speculative reason were merely problematic.

**Key Distinctions and Contrasts**
22. **Autonomy vs. Heteronomy:** A will determined by its own law (the moral law) is autonomous; a will determined by any external object, desire, or authority is heteronomous.
23. **Categorical vs. Hypothetical Imperatives:** Only categorical imperatives (unconditional "oughts") are moral. Hypothetical imperatives are rules of skill or prudence.
24. **Practical Law vs. Maxim:** A practical law is objectively valid for all rational beings; a maxim is a subjective principle of volition.
25. **Formal vs. Material Practical Principles:** Moral principles are formal (concerned with the law's form); all material principles (based on an object of desire) are empirical and cannot found a moral law.
26. **Intelligible vs. Sensible World:** We must conceive ourselves as belonging to an intelligible world (*noumenal*) governed by laws of freedom, and a sensible world (*phenomenal*) governed by natural causality.
27. **Personhood vs. Thinghood:** Rational beings are *persons* (ends in themselves); non-rational beings are *things* (means only).
28. **The Good Will as Unconditionally Good:** The only thing good without qualification is a good will—a will whose maxims conform to the moral law.
29. **Moral Worth Lies in the Maxim:** The moral worth of an action lies not in its effect but in the principle of the will (the maxim) from which it is done.
30. **Duty as Necessitation:** For finite rational beings (who have inclinations), the moral law presents itself as a *duty*—a necessitation or constraint.
31. **Virtue as Moral Strength:** Virtue is the strength of a human being's maxims in fulfilling his duty—the fortitude to resist inclinations contrary to the law.
32. **Happiness Cannot be the Ground of Morality:** Any ethical system making happiness (even the general welfare) the foundation is heteronomous and fails to capture the unconditional nature of moral obligation.
33. **Freedom is Transcendental Ideality but Practical Reality:** As a theoretical concept, freedom is an idea of reason; as a practical concept, it is a real property of our will.
34. **The Will is Causality of a Rational Being:** The will is a kind of causality belonging to living beings insofar as they are rational.
35. **The Moral Law is a "Determining Ground" of the Will:** It is not just a rule but an active power to cause action independently of sensibility.
36. **Consciousness of the Moral Law is Undeniable:** Any attempt to doubt it already presupposes a moral standard by which the doubt is judged.
37. **Practical Reason Has No Need of a "Deduction":** Unlike the categories of theoretical reason, the moral law needs no deduction because it is a fact of reason.
38. **Against Empiricism in Ethics:** All principles based on experience (happiness, moral sense, education, civil constitution) are unfit to serve as the foundation of moral laws.
39. **Against Rationalistic Dogmatism (e.g., Wolff):** Perfection as a concept, if not defined morally, is empty and cannot serve as a first moral principle.
40. **The "Two Standpoints" Resolution:** The conflict between natural causality and freedom is resolved by viewing the same subject from two perspectives: as phenomenon (determined) and as noumenon (free).
41. **The Moral Law is Given by Reason Itself (*a priori*):** It is not a discovery from anthropology or psychology.
42. **Pure Practical Reason "Fills a Gap" in the Critical System:** It gives content to the ideas of reason that the first *Critique* left empty.
43. **The Incentive of Pure Practical Reason Must Be Pure:** It cannot involve any sensuous desire or fear of punishment/ hope of reward.
44. **The Concept of the Highest Good is Necessary for Consistent Moral Volition:** To will in accordance with the moral law is to will the final end which reason connects with it—the *summum bonum*.
45. **Happiness as Part of the *Summum Bonum* is Morally Conditioned:** It is not happiness in general, but happiness *proportionate to virtue* that is willed.
46. **The Postulates Concern Existence, Not Just Concepts:** They assert the actual existence of God and an immortal soul, but only from a practical point of view.
47. **The Unity of Reason:** Ultimately, there is only one human reason, used theoretically and practically. Its practical use has primacy in the sphere of ends.
48. **The Moral Law is Sovereign:** It brooks no rival determining grounds and demands unconditional submission.
49. **The Method of Pure Practical Reason is Ascending:** It begins with the analysis of ordinary moral consciousness and ascends to its supreme principle.
50. **The "Starry Heavens Above and the Moral Law Within":** The famous conclusion contrasts theoretical reason's contemplation of the natural world with practical reason's awe at the moral law in our own being.

Of course. Here is one question for each of the 50 core contentions from Kant's *Critique of Practical Reason*, designed so that the listed contention would be the essential starting point for a meaningful answer.

---

**Part I: The Analytic of Pure Practical Reason**
1.  Which has priority: reason's ability to know the world or reason's ability to guide our moral actions, and why?
2.  How can we be absolutely certain of a universal moral law if we can't observe it in the world?
3.  What is the single, supreme formulation of the principle that should govern all truly moral decisions?
4.  What is the underlying metaphysical reality that *makes morality possible* in the first place?
5.  Given that we can't *prove* we are free through science or observation, how do we come to *know* our own freedom?
6.  Can we ever truly be held responsible for our actions if our choices are just links in a chain of natural causes?
7.  How do we define "good" and "evil" in a way that isn't just based on personal taste or social convention?
8.  Can a moral principle be based on the desired outcome or goal of an action, or must it be based on something else?
9.  How do we bridge the gap between the abstract moral law and the concrete, natural world in which we must apply it?
10. What is the specific emotional force that should drive a purely moral act, since desires for reward or fear of punishment corrupt it?
11. Why does the feeling that accompanies moral duty feel like a form of humiliation or a blow to our self-esteem?
12. What is the ultimate, complete goal that a morally committed person must rationally strive for?
13. Is being a virtuous person sufficient for a completely good and fulfilling life, or is something else required?
14. Isn't there a fundamental contradiction between the pursuit of moral virtue and the natural human desire for happiness?
15. If virtue and happiness don't reliably align in this life, what must a rational moral agent believe to avoid despair?

**Part II: The Dialectic of Practical Reason**
16. Are there fundamental truths about reality that we cannot *know* scientifically but must nevertheless *believe* in order to be moral?
17. If moral perfection is demanded of us but is impossible to achieve in a lifetime, how is the moral demand not a cruel absurdity?
18. What must we presuppose to make sense of a universe where moral effort is ultimately matched by appropriate happiness?
19. Is belief in God a matter of blind faith, empirical evidence, or a necessary commitment of a rational moral agent?
20. Can we prove God's existence not from the design of the world, but from the demands of our own moral conscience?
21. Does morality grant us a kind of "knowledge" of realities—like God and the soul—that science and pure logic cannot reach?

**Key Distinctions and Contrasts**
22. What is the essential difference between acting from your own rational principle and acting according to the principles of your culture, desires, or a commanding authority?
23. How is a moral "ought" fundamentally different from the advice, "If you want X, you ought to do Y"?
24. What separates a personal rule of thumb from a universal command of reason?
25. Why can't a moral rule be something like, "Promote pleasure" or "Achieve excellence," if those are good things?
26. How can one and the same person be subject to the unbreakable laws of physics and also be truly free?
27. What is the fundamental moral distinction between a human being and a tool or a pet?
28. Can intelligence, courage, or wealth be considered truly "good" in all circumstances, or is their value conditional?
29. Does the moral value of saving a life change if you do it for a reward versus out of a sense of duty?
30. Why does doing the right thing often feel like a struggle or a constraint, rather than something we do effortlessly?
31. If virtue isn't just about knowing the good, what is the essential quality of a virtuous character?
32. Why is an ethics based on creating the greatest happiness for the greatest number ultimately an unstable foundation for morality?
33. Is freedom just a useful illusion for practical life, or does it have a genuine kind of reality?
34. What specific human faculty is the source of genuinely new actions that are not just the product of prior natural causes?
35. How can a mere *idea* or *principle* be the direct *cause* of a physical action in the world?
36. Could a person genuinely deny that they have any sense of moral "ought" at all?
37. Why does the fundamental principle of morality not require a complex philosophical justification the way, for example, the concept of causation does?
38. Can we derive valid moral rules by studying what makes people happy across different cultures and histories?
39. Is the concept of "perfection," if not defined by morality first, a coherent guide for ethical action?
40. How do we resolve the paradox that we experience ourselves as both determined physical objects and free moral agents?
41. Where does our knowledge of the moral law come from, if not from observing human behavior?
42. What does the second Critique accomplish that the first *Critique of Pure Reason* could not?
43. What kind of psychological drive or "motive" is appropriate for a purely moral action that isn't tainted by self-interest?
44. Why is it not enough for a moral agent to simply follow individual duties; what final, complete end must they also will?
45. Is it morally permissible or even required to desire happiness for oneself?
46. Does the moral argument merely give us a comforting idea of God, or does it compel us to believe in God's actual *existence*?
47. Is the reason we use in science and the reason we use in ethics fundamentally different, or are they the same faculty?
48. Can a moral command ever be balanced against or overridden by pragmatic concerns or personal loyalties?
49. Do we discover the moral law by starting with complex philosophical systems, or by analyzing the common moral understanding we already possess?
50. What are the two sources of profound awe for a rational being, one pointing outward to the cosmos and the other inward to the self?
