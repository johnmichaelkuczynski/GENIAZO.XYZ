Your “model builder” is broken because it’s doing the wrong task.

What’s wrong (in plain English)

It outputs an essay instead of a model.
A model is a structured object: primitives, claims, dependencies, implications, and tensions.
Your output is generic exposition—nice-sounding paragraphs with no internal machinery.

It never commits to explicit claims.
It keeps saying “we must examine” / “the next step is” instead of stating what the theory actually asserts.

It doesn’t translate your entries into formal constraints.
Your input is already structured: (quote) + (topic label).
The function should convert those into numbered theses grouped by topic. It doesn’t.

It doesn’t derive anything.
A model builder should produce consequences (“if these theses are true, then…”) and show how clusters connect.
Yours produces zero derivations.

It adds filler concepts not in your input.
It imports “model-theoretic approach,” “primitives,” “truth conditions,” etc. as generic philosophy-talk, not as your specific doctrine.
So it feels like stock ChatGPT.

It ignores the category labels.
Your third column is basically the theory’s skeleton (“Philosophy as Meta-Knowledge,” “Logical Form vs Grammatical Form,” etc.).
The output should mirror that structure. It doesn’t.

It doesn’t preserve your voice.
Your input is sharp, declarative, and doctrinal.
The output is bland academic sludge.

It’s not checkable.
A user should be able to point at an output line and say: this corresponds to input line #37.
Your output can’t be audited against the input at all.

What the function must do instead (tell the agent this exactly)

Treat each row as an atomic thesis.

Output a hierarchical map of the theory:

clusters = your topic labels

within each cluster: numbered theses (verbatim or near-verbatim)

Then add:

core commitments (top 5–10 theses that everything else depends on)

derived implications (what follows if those commitments are true)

tensions / pressure points (where the theory is most vulnerable or where two clusters rub)

Zero filler. Zero “we will now.” Zero generic philosophy prose.

Every output claim must be traceable to at least one input line.

That’s what’s wrong: you built a “model builder” and it’s outputting a speech.
