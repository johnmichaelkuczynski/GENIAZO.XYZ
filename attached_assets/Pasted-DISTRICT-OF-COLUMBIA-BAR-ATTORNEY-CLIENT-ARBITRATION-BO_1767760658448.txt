IV. JURISDICTION
The ACAB has jurisdiction over this dispute pursuant to D.C. Court of Appeals Rule XIII because: (a) Respondent is a member of the D.C. Bar; (b) a substantial portion of the legal services were performed in the District of Columbia; and (c) the services included representation before a District of Columbia-area court (Montgomery County, Maryland Circuit Court).
V. NATURE OF THE DISPUTE
A. The Engagement
On February 21, 2025, Respondent sent Petitioner an engagement letter for representation in a trust litigation matter involving the Jane Casey Hughes Revocable Trust, which holds over $8 million in liquid assets. Petitioner signed the engagement letter on February 26, 2025 and paid an initial advance of $1,200. The engagement letter stated that Respondent would "abide by [Petitioner's] decisions concerning the objectives of the representation." The objective was distribution of Petitioner's inheritance.
B. Fees Paid
Between February 26, 2025 and August 20, 2025, Petitioner paid Respondent $20,315.52 in legal fees and trust advances. A detailed breakdown is attached as Exhibit A.
C. Sabotage of Principal Claim
On April 17, 2025, Respondent filed a complaint containing two counts: Count I (failure to provide information) and Count II (failure to distribute trust assets). Count II was the heart of the case—the mechanism to compel distribution of Petitioner's inheritance.
On May 13, 2025, without Petitioner's informed consent, Respondent wrote to opposing counsel:
"We are however comforted by the representations Ms. Reid has made on this front since we filed our complaint. Accordingly, we are prepared to withdraw our allegation that Ms. Reid has failed or refused to distribute the trust assets, and with it, Count II of our complaint."
On May 22, 2025, Respondent filed a Notice of Partial Voluntary Dismissal, eliminating Count II. The trustee never distributed. Nearly one year after the decedent's death, Petitioner has received nothing from a trust holding over $8 million.
D. Material Misrepresentations
On April 8, 2025 at 4:48 PM, Respondent stated: "Unfortunately, I do not currently have enough evidence to file what you are asking for." On April 10, 2025, Respondent stated: "I do feel that I already have enough to request an accounting and a disbursement." No new evidence was provided between these dates.
E. Retention of Unearned Funds
Respondent's December 14, 2025 invoice states he is holding $1,500 in his client trust account "pending resolution of our fee dispute." The invoice also states: "No charges have accrued since my invoice of December 11, 2025" and confirms no work was performed after August 20, 2025. These funds are undisputedly unearned.
F. Result
Petitioner paid $20,315.52. Respondent achieved nothing. The lawsuit was gutted by Respondent's voluntary dismissal of the distribution claim. Petitioner has received $0 of his inheritance. Respondent abandoned the representation in December 2025 when Petitioner attempted to pursue distribution.
VI. RELIEF REQUESTED
Petitioner respectfully requests that the ACAB:
1. Order Respondent to refund the full amount of $19,565.52;
2. Order immediate return of the $1,500.00 in unearned trust funds;
3. Award such other relief as the ACAB deems just and appropriate.
VII. EXHIBITS
Exhibit A: Summary of Fees Paid
Exhibit B: Key Email Excerpts (May 13, 2025 "comforted" email; April 8 and April 10, 2025 contradictory statements)
Exhibit C: Notice of Partial Voluntary Dismissal (May 22, 2025)
VIII. VERIFICATION
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
