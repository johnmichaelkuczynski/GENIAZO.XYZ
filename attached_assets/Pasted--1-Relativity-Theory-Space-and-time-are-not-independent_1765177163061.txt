**1. Relativity Theory**

- Space and time are not independent realities but form a unified four-dimensional manifold; the separation into space and time is relative to the observer and lacks absolute significance.
- Simultaneity is not an objective relation between distant events; it is defined relative to a coordinate system, and no physical fact determines absolute simultaneity.
- The "block universe" interpretation is correct: all events—past, present, and future—are equally real; temporal passage is a feature of consciousness, not of physical reality.
- Geometry is an empirical science, not a priori; the geometry of physical space is determined by measurement and is Riemannian rather than Euclidean.
- General relativity eliminates gravitational force in favor of the curvature of space-time; gravity is not a force acting at a distance but a manifestation of geometry.
- The equivalence of mass and energy reveals that matter is not a substance but a form of energy; what we call "matter" is a convenient way of speaking about certain energy configurations.
- Causation survives relativity but must be reinterpreted; causal relations hold between events in the light-cone structure, preserving the impossibility of backward causation.
- The speed of light functions as a limiting velocity built into the structure of space-time; it is not an empirical generalization but a structural feature of the manifold.
- Relativity supports a relational rather than absolute theory of motion; there is no absolute space serving as a reference frame for motion.
- The philosophical significance of relativity is the elimination of superfluous metaphysical entities—absolute space, absolute time, ether—in favor of structural relations among events.

**2. Structure of the Atom**

- Subatomic particles are not miniature billiard balls but logical constructions out of events; what we call an "electron" is a series of causally connected occurrences.
- The discreteness of atomic structure does not conflict with macroscopic continuity; continuity at one level can emerge from discreteness at another through statistical aggregation.
- An electron is best understood as a series of events having certain structural properties; it is not a persistent substance but a logical fiction convenient for physics.
- "Empty space" within the atom is not genuinely empty; it is a region where certain types of events do not occur, but the field permeates all space.
- The mathematical model of the atom represents structure, not intrinsic qualities; physics tells us about relations, not about the intrinsic nature of what is related.
- Electron "orbits" are not spatial trajectories but probability distributions; the classical picture of an electron circling a nucleus is fundamentally misleading.
- Atomic stability is explained by quantum constraints, not by mechanical equilibrium; the persistence of atomic structure depends on the quantization of energy levels.
- The properties of atoms are not simply additive combinations of constituent properties; wholes can have properties not predictable from parts considered in isolation.
- The nucleus is a composite entity with internal structure, but it functions as a unit in most chemical and physical contexts.
- The atom of physics is more fundamental than the atom of chemistry; chemical properties are derivative from physical structure and quantum mechanical behavior.

**3. Quantum Theory**

- Quantum mechanics provides knowledge of structure and probability, not knowledge of intrinsic qualities or determinate states prior to measurement.
- Superposition should be interpreted epistemically; we cannot say a particle is simultaneously in multiple states, only that we cannot assign it a definite state.
- The collapse of the wave function is better understood as a change in our knowledge than as a physical process; it reflects the acquisition of information through measurement.
- Quantum indeterminacy may be ontological, but we cannot definitively settle whether it reflects genuine indeterminism or merely the limits of possible knowledge.
- Quantum probability is sui generis; it is not reducible to classical ignorance but represents something new about the relationship between knowledge and reality.
- Non-locality challenges classical intuitions but does not permit superluminal signaling; the correlations are real but do not violate relativistic constraints on causation.
- The principle of sufficient reason must be modified or abandoned in light of quantum mechanics; not every event has a determining cause.
- Completeness in physics may be unattainable; there may be no complete description of a physical system that determines all measurement outcomes.
- Observation plays an essential role in quantum mechanics, but this need not imply that consciousness is a physical agent; measurement involves physical interaction, not mental acts.
- Quantum mechanics forces us to abandon the assumption that physical objects have all their properties definitely at all times; this is a revision to common sense, not a refutation of realism.

**4. Inductive Inference**

- Induction cannot be justified by deductive logic; no formal argument can demonstrate that the future will resemble the past without assuming what is to be proved.
- Induction is not merely psychological habit (pace Hume); it is a rational procedure, but its rationality rests on postulates that cannot themselves be inductively or deductively established.
- The justification of induction, if there is one, must rest on synthetic a priori principles or on postulates accepted for their fruitfulness in generating knowledge.
- Good inductive arguments are distinguished by variety of instances, absence of counterexamples, and conformity to structural principles about natural kinds and causal regularities.
- The uniformity of nature is not an empirical discovery but a presupposition of empirical inquiry; without it, learning from experience would be impossible.
- Projectible properties are those that correspond to genuine natural kinds; "grue"-type predicates fail because they do not carve nature at its joints.
- Induction is intimately connected with probability; an inductive conclusion is not certain but is rendered probable by the evidence.
- Induction can yield rational belief and even knowledge in a fallibilist sense, though not certainty; most of our knowledge rests on inductive foundations.
- There is no fixed number of instances that validates induction; the strength of inductive inference depends on the variety and relevance of evidence, not mere quantity.
- Induction is not eliminable; hypothetico-deductive method presupposes induction in accepting that successful predictions confirm theories.

**5. Postulates of Scientific Inference**

- Scientific inference requires postulates that are neither self-evident nor empirically provable; they are presupposed by the practice of science and justified by their fruits.
- The postulates include: quasi-permanence (things persist with gradual change), separable causal lines (causal processes can be traced independently), spatio-temporal continuity (causes and effects are contiguous), structural constancy, and analogy (similar structures have similar causal properties).
- These postulates are not a priori in the Kantian sense but are conditions for the possibility of the kind of knowledge science provides.
- The causal principle—that similar causes produce similar effects—is a postulate, not an empirical generalization; it underlies the possibility of generalization from experience.
- Natural kinds are presupposed by scientific inference; we assume that nature divides into classes whose members share causally relevant properties.
- Structural continuity—the assumption that structure is preserved across time and through causal processes—is essential for inference from percepts to physical objects.
- The postulates are revisable in the sense that we might find we need different postulates, but science cannot proceed without some such presuppositions.
- The principle that unobserved entities behave like observed ones is a form of the analogy postulate; it justifies inference from samples to populations.
- The minimum set of postulates is difficult to specify precisely, but they must collectively enable inductive generalization, causal inference, and the postulation of unobserved entities.
- The assumption of persistent objects is itself a postulate; what we call a "thing" is a series of events grouped together by causal continuity.

**6. Probability**

- Probability has both objective and subjective aspects; there are objective frequencies and propensities, but probability also measures rational credence given evidence.
- The frequency theory captures part of what we mean by probability: the probability of an event type is the limit of its relative frequency in a long series of trials.
- Single-case probabilities are problematic for frequency theory; we can meaningfully assign probabilities to individual events by treating them as members of reference classes.
- The principle of indifference—assigning equal probabilities to alternatives when we have no reason to favor one over another—is useful but must be applied cautiously to avoid paradoxes.
- In the absence of evidence, we may assign probabilities based on structural considerations or the principle of indifference, but such assignments are tentative and revisable.
- Objective chance may exist in quantum mechanics; if so, not all probability is epistemic, and some events are genuinely indeterministic.
- Probability and possibility are distinct; probability measures degrees of rational expectation, while possibility concerns what could be the case.
- Probability cannot be defined without some circularity or primitive notion; attempts to reduce probability to frequency or logical relations face significant difficulties.
- Probability statements about the past are meaningful; they express what it was rational to expect given the evidence available at the time.
- Bayesian reasoning is a rational method for updating probabilities in light of evidence, though the assignment of prior probabilities remains problematic.

**7. Logical Positivism**

- The verification principle faces serious difficulties: it is not itself empirically verifiable, and it excludes statements we have good reason to consider meaningful.
- Meaning cannot be exhaustively analyzed in terms of verification conditions; theoretical terms in science have meaning even when not directly verifiable.
- Logical and mathematical truths are analytic and a priori; they do not describe the world but are true in virtue of the meanings of their terms.
- Metaphysical statements are not necessarily meaningless; some metaphysical claims are false and therefore meaningful, while others may be genuinely undecidable.
- Universal generalizations have meaning even though they cannot be conclusively verified; they can be confirmed by evidence and falsified by counterexamples.
- The analytic/synthetic distinction is defensible but not as sharp as the positivists supposed; there is a continuum from purely logical truths to purely empirical claims.
- Counterfactuals and dispositional statements are meaningful and reducible to statements about regularities and structures, though the analysis is complex.
- Ethics cannot be reduced to mere emotion; there are rational considerations in ethics, even if moral judgments are not empirically verifiable in the same way as scientific claims.
- The demarcation between science and non-science is not sharp; science is distinguished by method and degree of confirmation, not by a clear boundary.
- The unity of science is a methodological ideal; all sciences share logical structure and empirical method, but reduction to physics is not always possible or illuminating.

**8. The Differential Calculus**

- Infinitesimals, as conceived by Leibniz, are logically suspect; the calculus is rigorously grounded in the concept of limit, which involves only finite quantities.
- Limits provide the rigorous foundation: a derivative is the limit of difference quotients, and an integral is the limit of sums, with no need for actually infinitesimal quantities.
- Instantaneous velocity is a mathematical construct defined as a limit; it is not a velocity possessed at an instant but a limit of average velocities over shrinking intervals.
- Mathematical continuity is precisely defined in terms of limits and epsilon-delta conditions; physical continuity is an empirical question about whether nature admits discontinuities.
- The calculus is both a discovery about the structure of the continuum and an invention providing tools for physics; the question of discovery versus invention is less important than the question of utility and correctness.
- The continuous and the discrete are both mathematically legitimate; the real numbers provide a model of continuity, while the integers model discreteness.
- Motion can be analyzed into a series of positions at times; the appearance of an irreducible dynamic element is an illusion, as Zeno's paradoxes show once properly resolved.
- Rates of change at an instant are defined through limits and do not require actual change at the instant; the limit captures what happens arbitrarily close to the instant.
- The mathematical concept of limit is idealized; physical measurement always involves finite precision, but the idealization is justified by its theoretical success.
- The calculus presupposes only the potential infinite—the unbounded continuation of a process—not the actual infinite, though Cantor showed the actual infinite is also coherent.

**9. Surds (Square Circles, Married Bachelors)**

- Impossible objects have no being whatsoever; there is no realm of subsistence for self-contradictory entities. The round square does not subsist; it simply is not.
- We can think about what cannot exist by entertaining propositional contents; to think of a round square is to entertain the proposition "x is round and x is square" without asserting it or referring to an object.
- Logical impossibility is absolute impossibility; what violates the laws of logic cannot exist in any possible world or under any conceivable circumstances.
- Self-contradictory descriptions are meaningful in the sense that we understand what they deny; "round square" is meaningful because we understand roundness and squareness and their incompatibility.
- There are no degrees of impossibility; all contradictions are equally impossible, though some may involve more obvious contradictions than others.
- Conceivability is a fallible guide to possibility; we may think we conceive something that is actually impossible, or fail to conceive something that is possible.
- Statements about impossibilia are meaningful and false; "the round square is round" is false because there is no round square, not meaningless.
- The law of non-contradiction is a fundamental logical truth; it is not a mere psychological habit or a metaphysical postulate but a condition of intelligible discourse.
- Terms like "square circle" do not refer; they are definite descriptions that fail to be satisfied by any object whatsoever.
- We cannot coherently quantify over impossible objects; to say "there exists a round square" is simply false, not true in some impossible-object domain.

**10. The Theory of Descriptions**

- Definite descriptions are not names but quantified expressions; "the F" means "there is exactly one F, and it..."
- Sentences about nonexistent objects are meaningful and false, not meaningless; "the present King of France is bald" is false because there is no present King of France.
- "The present King of France is bald" is false, not truth-valueless; it asserts the existence of a unique King of France, and that assertion is false.
- Grammatical form systematically misleads us about logical form; the surface subject-predicate structure conceals underlying quantificational complexity.
- Definite descriptions differ fundamentally from proper names; genuine names refer directly, while descriptions work through satisfaction of a predicate.
- Presupposition can be analyzed in terms of assertion; what appears to be presupposed is part of what is asserted, and so a failed presupposition yields falsehood.
- In intensional contexts, descriptions exhibit scope ambiguities; "George IV wished to know whether Scott was the author of Waverley" can be read with the description inside or outside the scope of "wished."
- Indefinite descriptions ("a man") are existential quantifiers without the uniqueness condition; "a man came" means "there exists at least one man who came."
- An expression is a genuine name if it refers directly without descriptive content; most apparent names in ordinary language are disguised descriptions.
- Sentences with multiple descriptions require careful attention to scope; "the father of the author of Waverley" involves nested descriptions each requiring existential-uniqueness analysis.

**11. The Nature of Entailment**

- Entailment is a relation between propositions such that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false; it is stricter than material implication.
- Material implication is truth-functional and weaker than entailment; "p materially implies q" means merely "not (p and not-q)," which holds whenever q is true or p is false.
- Logical entailment holds in virtue of logical form alone; analytic entailment may depend on the meanings of non-logical terms.
- The paradoxes of material implication (a false proposition implies anything, a necessary truth is implied by anything) are not paradoxes of entailment proper; entailment requires a stronger connection.
- A contradiction entails everything in classical logic (ex falso quodlibet); this is a feature of the logic, though relevance logicians dispute whether it captures genuine entailment.
- Entailment is connected to explanation but distinct from it; A may entail B without explaining B (e.g., a conjunction entails its conjuncts but does not explain them).
- Entailment is necessary; if A entails B, then in all possible circumstances where A holds, B holds.
- Relevance may be desirable for a notion of entailment closer to ordinary reasoning, but classical entailment does not require it.
- Non-classical logics may define entailment differently, but they depart from the standard logical framework that underlies mathematics and science.
- Entailment is a semantic relation (about truth preservation across possibilities); deducibility is a syntactic relation (about derivation in a formal system). In a complete logic, they coincide.

**12. The Relationship Between "Logic" and Philosophy**

- Logic is the essence of philosophy; philosophical problems, properly analyzed, are problems of logic or dissolve under logical scrutiny.
- Many traditional philosophical problems arise from linguistic confusion; logical analysis can expose pseudo-problems that arise from misunderstanding the logical form of statements.
- Formal logic is a tool for clarifying natural language, but natural language is often logically misleading; the task of philosophy is to replace vague ordinary language with precise logical notation.
- Logical truths are substantive in that they are necessarily true and govern all possible thought; they are not empty because they exclude contradictory states of affairs.
- Logic reveals the structure of thought and, to the extent that thought can represent reality, the structure of possible reality; but logic alone does not tell us what actually exists.
- Philosophy has a distinctive method: logical analysis, which distinguishes it from empirical science while remaining complementary to science.
- The scope of logical analysis is broad; virtually all meaningful statements can be clarified through logical paraphrase, though some may resist complete analysis.
- A logic carries ontological commitments; adopting a logic with certain quantifiers and predicates commits one to certain kinds of entities.
- Philosophical intuitions must yield to logical argument when they conflict; an intuition that leads to contradiction must be abandoned.
- Philosophy, properly conceived, is continuous with science; it differs in generality and in attention to logical structure but not in fundamental method.

**13. Formalism**

- Mathematics cannot be reduced to the mere manipulation of uninterpreted symbols; mathematical propositions have content and are about something, even if that something is abstract.
- A mathematical proof is not a sequence of marks but a demonstration that certain propositions follow from others; the marks represent meaningful assertions.
- The applicability of mathematics to reality is inexplicable if mathematics is merely a game; the fact that mathematical structures correspond to physical structures shows mathematics has content.
- Formal systems are important for rigor, but mathematical truth is not constituted by formal derivability; Gödel showed that truth outruns provability in any consistent system.
- Consistency is necessary but not sufficient for mathematical legitimacy; a consistent system of arbitrary axioms does not constitute mathematics unless it captures mathematical truths.
- Metamathematics is itself interpreted mathematics; we reason mathematically about formal systems, presupposing the mathematics we use in that reasoning.
- Gödel's incompleteness theorems refute strong formalism; no consistent formal system can capture all arithmetic truths, showing mathematics is not reducible to formalism.
- Mathematical content exceeds what is captured in formal systems; we understand what the formal systems are about, and this understanding is irreducibly semantic.
- Mathematical symbolism is not mere notation but expresses definite logical content; the symbols abbreviate complex logical claims.
- Formalism cannot account for mathematical understanding; a machine can manipulate symbols without understanding, but mathematicians grasp meanings.

**14. Intuitionism**

- Mathematical existence should not be tied exclusively to constructibility; the classical notion of existence, independent of our ability to construct, is legitimate and coherent.
- The law of excluded middle is valid for well-defined propositions, including those about infinite domains; denying it for mathematical statements impoverishes mathematics unnecessarily.
- A mathematical construction is a procedure for establishing a truth; but there may be truths that we cannot establish, and they are truths nonetheless.
- Classical mathematics is not inconsistent; intuitionism restricts mathematics based on epistemological scruples that are not mandated by logic itself.
- Mathematical truth is distinct from mathematical proof; a proposition may be true even if we have no way of proving it.
- Intuitionism creates difficulties for applied mathematics; much of physics relies on classical analysis, which intuitionists reject.
- For undecidable propositions, there is a fact of the matter; Goldbach's conjecture is either true or false, even if we never determine which.
- Completed infinities are legitimate mathematical objects; the set of natural numbers exists as a completed totality, not merely as an indefinitely extensible sequence.
- Mathematical objects that cannot be constructed may still exist; existence in mathematics is not dependent on human cognitive capacities.
- The intuitionistic conception is not psychologistic in the crude sense, but it does tie mathematics too closely to human epistemic limitations.

**15. Logicism**

- All mathematical concepts can be defined in purely logical terms; number, successor, addition, and all of arithmetic can be constructed from logical notions.
- The concept of number is definable logically; a number is the class of all classes equinumerous to a given class (or, in type theory, a more refined version of this).
- The axioms required to derive mathematics from logic are: axioms of logic, the axiom of infinity, and the axiom of reducibility (or some substitute); whether these are "logical" is debatable.
- The axiom of infinity—that there exist infinitely many individuals—is not a logical truth in the traditional sense; it is a postulate required for mathematics but goes beyond pure logic.
- The axiom of reducibility was introduced to overcome difficulties in type theory; it is controversial whether it is a logical axiom or a mathematical one.
- Set theory can be considered part of logic if logic is understood broadly to include the theory of classes; the boundary between logic and mathematics is not sharp.
- The distinction between logic and mathematics becomes blurred under logicism; mathematics is logic, so there is no deep distinction, only a division of labor.
- Gödel's theorems show that arithmetic truth cannot be completely captured in any formal system, but this does not refute logicism; it shows that logic itself is inexhaustible.
- Logical and mathematical knowledge feel different because mathematical proofs are complex and not immediately obvious; but this is a psychological difference, not a difference in kind.
- Logical types are necessary to avoid paradoxes; the ramified theory of types provides a hierarchy that prevents self-referential definitions.

**16. Empiricism and Its Limits**

- All substantive knowledge of the world derives ultimately from sensory experience; but logic and mathematics are a priori and do not depend on experience for their justification.
- Logical and mathematical truths are analytic, true in virtue of meaning; they do not describe the world and hence do not conflict with empiricism properly understood.
- General truths are known through induction from particular experiences, but induction presupposes principles (postulates of scientific inference) that are not themselves empirical.
- The concept of causation is derived from experience of regular succession, but the causal principle—that similar causes produce similar effects—is a postulate, not an empirical observation.
- Theoretical entities in science are logical constructions out of sense-data or events; they are not directly observed but are inferred as explanatory posits.
- Knowledge of our own minds comes through introspection, which is a form of experience, but introspection is fallible and does not give us complete or incorrigible knowledge.
- The principle that all synthetic knowledge comes from experience is itself not empirical but a philosophical postulate; it is justified by its role in a coherent theory of knowledge.
- A priori knowledge of logic and mathematics is compatible with empiricism because such knowledge does not tell us what exists but only what follows from what.
- Experience provides the content of our knowledge, but the categories and forms we use to organize experience have a contribution from the mind, though not in the strong Kantian sense.
- Experience has limits: it cannot tell us about the intrinsic nature of physical reality, only about structure and relations; the qualitative character of matter remains unknown.

**17. Rationalism and Its Limits**

- Reason alone, independent of experience, yields knowledge of logic and mathematics but not knowledge of what exists in the world.
- Self-evident truths exist in logic and mathematics; some propositions are known to be true by anyone who understands them.
- The applicability of reason to the world is a fortunate fact; we cannot explain a priori why logical and mathematical structures are exemplified in nature.
- Rationalist metaphysics, when it claims to deduce the nature of reality from pure reason, oversteps; Hegel's dialectic, Spinoza's geometric method, and similar systems are unwarranted.
- Logical necessity is absolute and applies to all possible worlds; metaphysical necessity, if distinct, would require additional justification that reason alone cannot provide.
- Synthetic a priori knowledge, if it exists, must be limited to formal principles; there is no synthetic a priori knowledge of particular features of the world.
- Reason can determine relations of ideas but not matters of existence; existence claims are always ultimately empirical.
- The distinction between genuine rational insight and prejudice lies in logical demonstrability; what can be proved from self-evident premises is rational, what cannot is suspect.
- Competing rationalist systems cannot all be correct; when they conflict, we must look for errors in reasoning or hidden empirical assumptions.
- Reason is a product of evolution, which raises questions about its reliability, but this does not undermine logic; even the skeptical argument relies on reason.

**18. Counterfactual Truth**

- Counterfactual conditionals are made true by the causal structure of the world; they are reducible to statements about laws of nature and initial conditions.
- Counterfactuals describe what would happen given the laws of nature; they are not merely expressions of our interests but objective claims about causal regularities.
- Counterfactuals are intimately related to causal claims; "if A had happened, B would have happened" holds when A-type events cause B-type events.
- Counterfactuals about the distant past are evaluated by considering what the laws of nature would produce given the counterfactual antecedent.
- The similarity relations relevant to counterfactuals are determined by the laws of nature and the causal structure they impose, not by arbitrary judgments.
- Counterfactuals with impossible antecedents (counterpossibles) are vacuously true or lack truth value; if the antecedent is impossible, we cannot meaningfully ask what would follow.
- Counterfactuals are closely tied to laws; a generalization supports counterfactuals if and only if it is a genuine law rather than an accidental regularity.
- Counterfactual truth can be analyzed in terms of non-counterfactual truth about laws and conditions; no irreducibly modal facts are required.
- What is held fixed in evaluating counterfactuals is determined by the causal independence of factors; we hold fixed what is causally independent of the antecedent.
- Counterfactual assertions express objective claims about causal structure; they are not merely pragmatic or context-dependent stipulations.

**19. Modality**

- Necessity is logical necessity; a proposition is necessary if its denial is self-contradictory. There is no metaphysical necessity distinct from logical necessity.
- Possible worlds are useful heuristics for thinking about modality, but they are not concrete realities; talk of possible worlds is reducible to talk about consistent sets of propositions.
- The actual world is distinguished as the world that obtains, the one whose propositions are true; other possible worlds are unrealized consistent descriptions.
- There is one fundamental notion of possibility: logical possibility (consistency with the laws of logic). Physical possibility is relative to laws of nature and is not a distinct modal notion.
- Modal truths are known through logic; what is necessary is what logic requires, and what is possible is what logic permits.
- Essence, if it means anything, is nominal essence—what follows from our definitions; real essences in the Aristotelian sense are rejected.
- Modal facts are reducible to logical facts; there are no irreducibly modal features of the world beyond logical structure.
- Contingent existence is existence that is not logically necessary; most things that exist do not exist by logical necessity, as their non-existence implies no contradiction.
- Modality is not fundamentally temporal; possibility does not mean "could be at some time" but "involves no contradiction."
- Modal concepts can be defined in terms of consistency and logical implication; possibility is consistency, necessity is implication from logical truths.
