2 KUCZYNSKI POSITION STATEMENTS

20 POSITIONS FROM "WHAT IS A FORMAL LANGUAGE?"
by J.-M. Kuczynski, PhD


ON THE STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE

1. A formal language may be identified with an ordered triple consisting of primitive expressions, grammar/syntax, and a meaning-function/semantics.

2. A primitive expression is one that cannot be decomposed into other expressions.

3. A grammar is a set of rules that strings of primitive expressions must satisfy to be grammatical.

4. An ungrammatical string is not an expression of any kind.

5. If a language has non-negligible expressive capabilities, its grammar is a recursion—defined for its own outputs.

6. All languages are recursively defined expression-classes.

7. A language is a recursive expression-class coupled with a meaning-function; without the meaning-function, it is merely an uninterpreted formal calculus.


ON NON-RECURSIVE EXPRESSION-CLASSES

8. No language can be infinite but not recursively defined, because expressions belonging to such a language would be unintelligible.

9. A non-recursive expression-class contains only finitely many symbols and is therefore vanishingly small compared to any natural language.

10. A non-recursive expression-class cannot make statements about its own statements and cannot identify logical relations among its sentences.

11. Two expressions belong to the same language only if they can be combined into a meaningful expression or one shares at least one constituent with the other.

12. An expression has expressive power only to the extent that what it means doesn't always collapse into what its users believe it to mean.


ON MEANING AND SEMANTICS

13. A meaning-function is a set of rules that identify, for any sentence, under what circumstances it is true and under what circumstances it is false.

14. The expression "meaning" is ambiguous between meaning-what (semantics/truth-conditions) and meaning-how (semantic decomposition/syntax).

15. Two sentences can have the same truth-conditions yet differ in meaning because they have different semantic decompositions.


ON FORMAL VS. NATURAL LANGUAGES

16. All languages are formal languages; a "formal language" is simply a language that is formally described.

17. Natural languages are not less formal than artificial formal languages—they are in fact hyper-formal, possessing too much structural integrity for their rules to be easily identified.

18. The positivist position that natural languages lack structural integrity is the exact opposite of the truth.

19. The concept of a perfectly formal language (where logical form is completely determined by syntax) is incoherent—a surd like a square circle.

20. A sentence's logical form is nothing other than its meaning, because a sentence's meaning is completely known when its inferential relations to all other sentences are known.

20 POSITIONS FROM "WHAT IS BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER?"


ON THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF BPD

1. People with borderline personality disorder have two distinct, simultaneously operative psychological "operating systems."

2. One of these operating systems is appropriately adult and sane; the other is infantile in nature.

3. One part of the BPD person's mind remained "stuck" or "fixated" at an early phase of life, usually very early childhood.

4. The part that remained stuck in early childhood did so because of a trauma, usually sexual molestation.

5. People with BPD oscillate between these two psychological integrations—sometimes the adult system is operative, sometimes the infantile one.


ON BPD BEHAVIOR AND PERCEPTION

6. People with BPD may instantaneously and frequently shift between their two modalities.

7. This shifting makes them appear to be lying or "playing games" when in fact they are shifting between two distinct and incongruent worldviews.

8. People with BPD may be extremely intelligent and intellectually developed.

9. During their lucid moments, they may seem—and in fact be—utterly sane and also utterly decent.

10. When they shift into their infantile mode, they become accusatory, narcissistic, and oftentimes violent.


ON BPD VS. PSYCHOPATHY

11. People with BPD are not psychopaths.

12. When the BPD person's infantile side predominates, they act in the same entitled, limitlessly self-servingly narcissistic way as psychopaths.

13. The psychopath is simply a phony who sometimes puts on a mask of sanity and decency.

14. The BPD person is genuinely two-sided—one side sane and decent, the other infantile and tyrannical—each side being genuine and therefore neither being a mask.

15. When the psychopath acts non-psychopathically, it is because he is just acting; when the BPD person acts non-psychopathically, it is because she is being true to one side of her personality.


ON SPLITTING VS. REPRESSION

16. The BPD person's preferred psychological defense is not repression but rather splitting.

17. The BPD personality-structure is itself the result of splitting.

18. Repression involves having a single psychological architecture and shoving incompatible feelings or drives into the abyss of the unconscious.

19. Splitting involves not having to repress because one shifts between one's adult side and one's infantile side—keeping infantilisms in a concurrently operative sphere rather than the unconscious.

20. The essence of BPD is that splitting (separation of the psyche into two distinct operating systems) takes the place of repression (depositing psychological discards into an unconscious subordinate to a non-infantile operating system).

ON RECURSION AND EXPRESSION

21. A grammar is typically a recursion consisting of many other recursions.

22. Given any sentence in a language, it is possible to form a new sentence out of it (via one-place or two-place sentential operators, etc.).

23. Points about formal languages are to be understood in terms of analogous truths about natural language.

24. Any recursively defined expression-class contains ℵ₀ (aleph-null) many expressions—the cardinality of the natural numbers.

25. A recursively defined class contains infinitely many times as many symbols as a non-recursively defined symbol-class.

26. A finite expression-class cannot possibly constitute a language, even an expressively impoverished one.


ON MEANING AND PRIMITIVE EXPRESSIONS

27. Proper names are defined contextually no less than predicates, logical operators, and grammatical markers.

28. A meaning-function identifies truth-conditions of sentences indirectly—by specifying how each primitive expression contributes to truth-conditions.

29. A sentence's semantics is known when its truth-conditions are known; its syntax is known when it is known how the rules assign those truth-conditions.

30. A sentence's meaning includes the information borne by it in virtue of both its semantics and its semantic-decomposition.


ON PERSPICUITY AND FORMALITY

31. A sentence is perspicuous to the extent that what it says can be absorbed into its syntax—i.e., its grammar and logical form are in alignment.

32. The extent to which inferences can be made about a sentence's logical form from its syntax is a function of what the examiner already knows.

33. The more primitive semantic rules a language has for outfitting sentence-level expressions with meanings, the less perspicuous its sentences are likely to be.

34. The degree to which a language's sentences are perspicuous is proportional to the number of primitive expressions composing those sentences.

35. One language is more formal than another if it contains fewer sentence-specific primitive semantic rules.

15 ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FROM "WHAT IS BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER?"


ON THE NATURE OF BPD OSCILLATION

21. The two operating systems in BPD are simultaneously operative, though only one dominates at any given time.

22. The infantile operating system in BPD absorbs the subject's various infantilisms and other psychological "discards."

23. Neither operating system in BPD has complete dominance over the other.

24. When the BPD person's infantile side dominates, this represents a regression, not a mask falling.


ON THE MECHANISM OF SPLITTING

25. The normal (non-BPD) person's psyche keeps its infantilism in the abyss of the unconscious.

26. The BPD person's psyche does not repress infantilisms but rather keeps them in a concurrently operative sphere of mental activity.

27. In BPD, the concurrently operative infantile sphere sometimes becomes the dominant one.

28. Splitting is the separation of the psyche into two distinct operating systems.


ON MISPERCEPTION OF BPD

29. When BPD individuals shift into their infantile mode, observers wrongly assume they were simply lying all along.

30. Observers wrongly conclude that BPD individuals are psychopaths wearing a mask of sanity and decency.

31. This inference—that BPD individuals were always deceptive—is the wrong inference to make.


ON THE BPD-PSYCHOPATHY DISTINCTION

32. There is a pronounced streak of psychopathy within the BPD person, but this differs from full-blown psychopathy.

33. When the psychopath acts psychopathically, it is because the mask has fallen; when the BPD person acts psychopathically, it is because she is regressing.

34. The psychopath's non-psychopathic behavior is acting; the BPD person's non-psychopathic behavior is genuine expression of one side of her personality.

35. Each side of the BPD person's personality is genuine—neither is a mask—whereas the psychopath's decency is always a mask.
