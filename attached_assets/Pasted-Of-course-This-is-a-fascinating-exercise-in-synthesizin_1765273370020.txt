***

### **I. WHAT THE IDEAL STATE IS (30 Positions)**
1. The ideal state is a republic founded on a social contract.
2. Sovereignty resides exclusively and inalienably in the people as a whole.
3. The sovereign is the collective body of citizens, not a ruler.
4. The state must be small enough for citizens to know each other.
5. Its laws should express the general will, not particular interests.
6. There should be no separate legislative body; the people legislate directly.
7. Citizenship requires active participation in popular assemblies.
8. The ideal state fosters civic virtue and patriotism above all.
9. Luxuries, arts, and sciences corrupt the civic spirit and should be limited.
10. It requires civil religion with minimal, universal dogmas (e.g., belief in a benevolent God, the afterlife, the sanctity of the social contract).
11. The government (executive) is merely an agent of the sovereign people.
12. Frequent assemblies of the people are necessary to reaffirm the social contract.
13. Laws should be few, clear, and focus on fundamental principles.
14. Censorship is legitimate to uphold morals and public opinion.
15. Private property is permitted but strictly regulated to prevent extreme inequality.
16. The goal of the state is liberty and equality, with equality defined as no citizen being rich enough to buy another or poor enough to sell themselves.
17. It is a moral and collective body with a common life and will.
18. The legislator is a foundational, quasi-divine figure who designs institutions to shape mores.
19. The state must be homogeneous in culture and custom.
20. There is no representation of sovereignty; delegation is only for administration.
21. The ideal state is self-sufficient and agrarian, not commercial.
22. It uses public festivals and games to strengthen communal bonds.
23. There is no need for complex political parties or factions.
24. The death penalty can be legitimate for those who break the social contract, as they are deemed "an enemy of the people."
25. Education should be public and national, designed to create citizens.
26. The rule of law is absolute; even magistrates are under, not above, the law.
27. It reconciles natural freedom with civil freedom (obedience to a law one prescribes to oneself).
28. Taxation should be progressive, falling heaviest on the rich.
29. The state's legitimacy depends on the constant, active consent of the governed.
30. Its ultimate end is the preservation and prosperity of its members.

### **II. THE NATURE OF RIGHTS (20 Positions)**
31. In the state of nature, man has natural rights to self-preservation and what he can attain.
32. Natural liberty is the right to everything one desires and can get.
33. In society, natural rights are transformed into civil rights secured by the community.
34. The fundamental right is the right to have rights, secured by membership in the polity.
35. Property becomes a civil right, legitimized only by the social contract and labor.
36. The first person to fence a plot of land and claim ownership was the founder of civil society and injustice.
37. The right of the strongest is not a true right; might does not make right.
38. True right is based on convention and agreement.
39. The social contract exchanges natural liberty for civil and moral liberty.
40. The right to life is inalienable, but one consents to the law that may punish it with death if one violates the contract.
41. There is no natural right to enslave others; slavery is always illegitimate.
42. Rights are not individual possessions against the group but are guaranteed by the general will.
43. The right to vote on the laws is an inalienable right of every citizen.
44. Renouncing one's liberty is to renounce one's quality as a man; it is morally impossible.
45. Children have a right to their father's protection, not to his property.
46. The people have an inalienable right to change their government and laws.
47. The right of property is the most sacred of all civil rights, but not more important than liberty.
48. War between states does not create a right to enslave conquered peoples.
49. The right of the sovereign over the subject does not exceed the bounds of public utility.
50. All rights in society flow from the social compact.

### **III. COLLECTIVE WILL (20 Positions)**
51. The general will is always right and tends toward the public utility.
52. The general will is not the will of all (which is the sum of private interests).
53. It is the will of the sovereign body considering the common good.
54. The general will is indivisible; it cannot be split or delegated.
55. It is inalienable; it cannot be represented by another body.
56. Each citizen must vote not on their private opinion, but on what they believe is the general will.
57. The general will is often silent or unknown; factions and partial societies distort it.
58. For the general will to be well expressed, there should be no associations within the state, or at least many equal ones.
59. It concerns itself only with matters that are general in both subject and object (laws that apply to all, made by all).
60. The law is the record and expression of the general will.
61. The general will is constant and unalterable, though people's perception of it may err.
62. Private will inevitably opposes the general will.
63. The social contract's essential clause is the total alienation of each associate to the whole community.
64. Whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be compelled to do so by the whole body; this means "he will be forced to be free."
65. The general will is not a metaphysical entity but the operational principle of a free people.
66. Unanimity is not required for the general will; a majority vote can discern it, assuming all citizens are properly informed and vote for the common good.
67. The general will cannot pronounce on a particular person or act (that is a decree, not a law).
68. It is founded on the common interest, which unites society.
69. Corruption occurs when private interests dominate and the general will is no longer consulted.
70. The general will is the source of legitimacy for all authority.

71. Legitimate authority derives only from covenants and consent.
72. Paternal authority over children is natural but temporary.
73. No man has natural authority over another.
74. Might does not create right; obedience is only due to legitimate powers.
75. The strongest is never strong enough to be always the master unless they transform strength into right.
76. The social contract is the only legitimate foundation of political authority.
77. Authority is illegitimate if it serves private or factional interests rather than the general will.
78. A government that ceases to execute the general will has usurped sovereignty and is illegitimate.
79. Any regime that requires constant force to maintain order is illegitimate.
80. Tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right.
81. Despotism is illegitimate because it places the master above the law.
82. Legitimacy requires that the sovereign people retain the legislative power.
83. Representation in legislation renders authority illegitimate; sovereignty cannot be represented.
84. Any constitution that allows extreme inequality of wealth or status is illegitimate.
85. Authority that deprives men of their moral freedom (autonomy) is illegitimate.
86. A contract that alienates total liberty (like slavery) is null and void, thus the authority based on it is illegitimate.
87. Legitimacy is sustained by periodic reaffirmation of the social compact in popular assemblies.
88. A government that becomes corrupt or changes its form without the people's consent acts illegitimately.
89. The moment a people is subjected to a master, the polity ceases to exist; the master's authority is zero.
90. Legitimate authority is always conditional on serving the common good.
91. Inheritance of political office is generally illegitimate, as it confuses property with magistracy.
92. Elections by the people are the proper, legitimate way to appoint magistrates (in all but hereditary monarchies, which he critiques).
93. Authority is illegitimate if it is based on divine right or conquest alone.
94. When the social bond is broken, the state is dissolved, and all authority reverts to the natural liberty of individuals.
95. The right of revolution is implicit when the government violates the social contract.

### **V. PRIMITIVE MAN (15 Positions)**

97. He was robust, healthy, and concerned only with immediate needs.
98. His two natural principles were self-preservation (*amour de soi*) and pity (*pitié*).

102. He was free from the torment of anticipating future needs or deaths.

105. He had no moral relations or duties with others.
106. Conflicts were rare and resolved by fights, not wars.
107. He was naturally idle and slept a great deal.
108. Natural inequalities (strength, agility) were minimal and politically insignificant.
109. He was not miserable; his condition was neutral, not a state of war.
110. This state was the true youth of the world.

### **VI. THE NOBLE SAVAGE (15 Positions)**
111. The "noble savage" lives in simple, scattered family units, not pure solitude.
112. He possesses a nascent reason and simple industry (huts, tools).
113. This stage is the happiest and most stable epoch for humanity.
114. He experiences the first expansions of the heart: conjugal love, paternal love.
115. Leisure gives rise to simple pleasures (singing, dancing).
116. This is the origin of private property within the family.
117. He is defined by *amour-propre* (vanity, pride) in its benign, comparative form.

123. He is capable of natural virtue and compassion.
124. His happiness is based on simplicity and self-sufficiency.
125. The invention of property marks the fall from this state: "The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying *This is mine*, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society."

### **VII. MEN VS. WOMEN (15 Positions)**
126. Men and women are fundamentally different in nature and purpose.
127. Man is strong and active; woman is weak and passive.
128. Man is made for knowing, woman for pleasing.

140. The differences are complementary, aiming for a harmonious union in marriage.

### **VIII. THE NATURE OF LOVE (15 Positions)**

142. Moral love (in society) is an artificial sentiment that fixes this desire exclusively on one object.
143. True love is a mixture of physical desire and moral esteem.
144. Love in its idealized form is a source of both supreme happiness and exquisite torment.
145. It is the most dangerous of passions because it creates absolute dependence on another's feelings.
146. Romantic love is a social construct, unknown to primitive man.
147. Jealousy is a product of *amour-propre* and the idea of property in love.
148. The illusion of love (its ideals and fantasies) is often more powerful than its reality.
149. Love should be based on mutual respect and shared taste, not just passion.
150. It can be a civilizing force, teaching empathy and sacrifice.
151. Excessive romanticism leads to weakness and effeminacy in men.

156. Primitive man was neither happy nor unhappy; he was neutral.
157. The "noble savage" in the early social stage was the happiest.
158. Civilization increases our faculties but decreases our happiness.
159. Happiness is found in the proportion of power to desire: reduce desires to match power.
160. True happiness is in feeling, not in reason.
161. It consists in freedom (not being dependent on other men) and self-sufficiency.
162. The happiest life is a simple, rural, self-contained life close to nature.

188. Leting children develop habits of dominion or servitude.
189. Prefering the ease of subjection to the effort of freedom.
190. Misunderstanding true freedom as doing what one pleases, rather than obeying a law one has prescribed to oneself.

### **XI. THE BEST FORM OF EDUCATION (15 Positions)**
191. The best education is negative: prevent vices and errors rather than inculcate virtues prematurely.
192. It must follow the natural development of the child's faculties (ages of nature).
193. The child learns through necessity, not words or books.
194. The tutor's role is to contrive situations where the pupil learns from the "order of things."
195. Physical education and hardening of the body come first.
196. Develop the senses before the intellect; reason is the last faculty to mature.
197. The child should have no moral lessons preached to him; he learns justice by experiencing injustice.
198. The central maxim: "Do what is good for you with the least possible harm to others."
199. The pupil, Emile, should learn a manual trade (e.g., carpentry) to be self-sufficient and independent.
200. The climax of education is learning to love rightly—finding a partner (Sophie) and understanding one's social and moral duties.

Excellent. Here is one question for each of the 200 positions, crafted such that Rousseau's stated position provides the core of the answer.
