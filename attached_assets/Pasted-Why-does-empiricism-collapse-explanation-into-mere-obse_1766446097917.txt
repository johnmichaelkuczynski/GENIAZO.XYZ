Why does empiricism collapse explanation into mere observation and thereby destroy the possibility of genuine structure in the external world?

Empiricism collapses explanation into mere observation by reducing complex phenomena to isolated data points, stripping away the possibility of discerning genuine structure in the external world. This approach fails to account for the underlying nomic connections—law-like relationships—that give coherence to reality beyond what is immediately perceived. My critique of empiricism, as developed in my work, centers on its inability to bridge the gap between raw sensory input and explanatory frameworks, ultimately rendering the external world a chaotic assembly of disconnected events.

At the heart of this failure is empiricism's identification of causation with correlation, a point I hammer home in my analysis. As I’ve written, "In identifying causation with correlation, Hume is therefore claiming that to explain an event is to show that it is an accident: to explain is to show that there is no explanation." This devastating flaw means that empiricism cannot distinguish between mere coincidence and true causal relationships. By equating explanation with the observation of repeated patterns, it denies the deeper structural principles that govern phenomena, leaving us with a world of accidents rather than intelligible order.

This reductionism is evident in how empiricism handles interdisciplinary relationships, such as between macro and micro phenomena. I argue, "This has the consequence, we will now see, that if any given macro-property is coextensive with some micro-property, that is nothing but an accident, and therefore has no explanatory value." Empiricism’s insistence on correlating observable properties without seeking underlying laws obscures the nomic structure of reality. It treats the alignment of macro and micro events as fortuitous rather than as evidence of a deeper, principled connection, thus destroying the possibility of genuine explanatory power.

Furthermore, empiricism’s methodological commitment to observation blinds it to the multiplicity of ways phenomena can be realized. As I’ve pointed out, "In W*, macrophenomena are multiply realizable with respect to microphenomena: given only that m(x) has macro-property phi, there are infinitely many distinct microproperties psi that x might have." This insight reveals that empiricism’s focus on observable correlations fails to capture the diverse underpinnings of reality. It cannot account for how a single macro-level phenomenon might arise from numerous micro-level configurations, thus missing the structural richness of the external world.

The problem extends to how empiricism addresses natural kinds and their causal properties. I note, "It is because of its causal properties that T is a tree; it isn't because of its effects on anyone's ideation." Empiricism, by tying knowledge of natural kinds to sensory experience alone, ignores the intrinsic causal structures that define entities independently of our perceptions. This observational bias prevents us from grasping the external world’s inherent organization, reducing trees, rocks, or hearts to mere bundles of sensory data rather than entities governed by objective laws.

Moreover, empiricism’s framework struggles with the distinction between different types of properties, further eroding structural understanding. I state, "Secondary-properties are properties of relations. (The relata in question are (or, rather, include) the observer and the observed.) Primary properties are properties of objects, not relations." By conflating these, empiricism cannot adequately explain how objective structures (primary properties) exist independently of subjective experience (secondary properties). This conflation flattens the external world into a subjective construct, devoid of independent structure.

Another critical issue is empiricism’s inability to handle the explanatory role of general propositions over specific events. I argue, "But it means that, in order for there to be any sense at all in which x's t*-density can be explained in terms of its t-place, the information already given must be supplemented with the sort of information that can only be given by general propositions - propositions concerning classes of events, as opposed to specific events." Empiricism’s focus on particular observations cannot yield the general laws necessary for true explanation, leaving the external world fragmented and without coherent structure.

This failure is compounded by empiricism’s treatment of induction, which lacks a foundation for connecting the known to the unknown. I critique, "It's only if we assume that nature is uniform - if we assume the truth of the uniformity principle (UP) - that we can justify 'things will be thus and so' on the basis of 'things thus far have been thus and so.'" Without a justified principle of uniformity, empiricism cannot build a structured view of reality from past observations to future predictions. It remains stuck in a loop of observational data without explanatory depth.

Empiricism also falters in its meta-explanatory stance, as it misjudges the role of theory in understanding. I assert, "Molecules aren't just unobservable: they are theoretical - it is on the basis of theory-heavy inferences that we know of their existence." By dismissing theoretical constructs as mere extensions of observation, empiricism denies the structural insights provided by theory, which are essential for understanding entities beyond direct perception. This rejection impoverishes our grasp of the external world’s underlying order.

The psychological implications of empiricism’s observational bias are equally damaging. I explain, "Empiricism doesn't describe how we actually think or how we should think. But it does describe a standard with respect to which it is appropriate to evaluate the thoughts we have had." By imposing a rigid standard that excludes involuntary or subpersonal processes, empiricism overlooks the complex mental structures that shape our interaction with the world. It reduces cognition to a series of observable responses, ignoring the deeper architecture of thought.

Additionally, empiricism’s handling of mental phenomena reveals its structural blindness. I write, "Not one of the statements just made is empirical. Each is analytically true. It would make no sense to say that empirical discoveries might prove that x's being content-bearing might not have the consequence that x was a mental entity." By failing to recognize the analytical truths that underpin mental states, empiricism cannot account for the structured nature of mind-world interactions, treating mental events as mere empirical data points rather than as part of a coherent system.

This observational collapse is further illustrated in empiricism’s struggle with idealism, which it inadvertently supports. I note, "If idealism is correct, our 'perceptions' have no objects at all, and they're therefore just hallucinations." Empiricism’s over-reliance on sensory data aligns it with idealism, denying an external reality independent of perception. This obliterates any notion of objective structure, as the world becomes nothing more than a projection of subjective experience.

Empiricism’s inadequacy in handling linguistic competence also underscores its failure to recognize structure. I argue, "Supposing such characterizations to be correct, the rules in question are not access-conscious, and they're obviously not access-unconscious in the same way as your antipathy towards your best friend." By reducing linguistic understanding to physiological responses, empiricism misses the rule-based, structural nature of language, which operates beyond mere observation.

Finally, empiricism’s methodological flaws prevent it from engaging with the second-order sensitivities necessary for true perception. I state, "So for any two members of oe1...oe, to so much as qualify as instances of single modality, it is necessary that GS be endowed with knowledge of (or knowledge-like sensitivity to) some one principle that assigns olfaction-specific properties to microphysical properties." Empiricism cannot account for the principled connections that integrate sensory data into coherent perceptual experiences, thus failing to recognize the structured nature of sensory processing itself.

In sum, empiricism’s collapse of explanation into observation destroys the possibility of genuine structure in the external world by denying the nomic, causal, and theoretical frameworks that underpin reality. It reduces the world to a series of disconnected sensory impressions, incapable of supporting the deeper laws and principles that I argue are essential for true understanding. This critique, grounded in my extensive analysis, reveals empiricism as a doctrine that, while claiming to describe reality, ultimately renders it unintelligible.
