Your “model builder” is broken because it’s doing the **wrong task**.

### What’s wrong (in plain English)

1. **It outputs an essay instead of a model.**
   A model is a structured object: primitives, claims, dependencies, implications, and tensions.
   Your output is generic exposition—nice-sounding paragraphs with no internal machinery.

2. **It never commits to explicit claims.**
   It keeps saying “we must examine” / “the next step is” instead of stating **what the theory actually asserts**.

3. **It doesn’t translate your entries into formal constraints.**
   Your input is already *structured*: (quote) + (topic label).
   The function should convert those into **numbered theses** grouped by topic. It doesn’t.

4. **It doesn’t derive anything.**
   A model builder should produce **consequences** (“if these theses are true, then…”) and show how clusters connect.
   Yours produces zero derivations.

5. **It adds filler concepts not in your input.**
   It imports “model-theoretic approach,” “primitives,” “truth conditions,” etc. as generic philosophy-talk, not as *your* specific doctrine.
   So it feels like stock ChatGPT.

6. **It ignores the category labels.**
   Your third column is basically the theory’s skeleton (“Philosophy as Meta-Knowledge,” “Logical Form vs Grammatical Form,” etc.).
   The output should mirror that structure. It doesn’t.

7. **It doesn’t preserve your voice.**
   Your input is sharp, declarative, and doctrinal.
   The output is bland academic sludge.

8. **It’s not checkable.**
   A user should be able to point at an output line and say: *this corresponds to input line #37.*
   Your output can’t be audited against the input at all.

---

### What the function must do instead (tell the agent this exactly)

* Treat each row as an **atomic thesis**.
* Output a **hierarchical map** of the theory:

  * clusters = your topic labels
  * within each cluster: numbered theses (verbatim or near-verbatim)
* Then add:

  * **core commitments** (top 5–10 theses that everything else depends on)
  * **derived implications** (what follows if those commitments are true)
  * **tensions / pressure points** (where the theory is most vulnerable or where two clusters rub)
* Zero filler. Zero “we will now.” Zero generic philosophy prose.
* Every output claim must be traceable to at least one input line.

That’s what’s wrong: **you built a “model builder” and it’s outputting a speech.**

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (what “MODEL BUILDER” must produce)

### MODEL TITLE

**Mechanisms, Explanation, and Rational Expectation (Kuczynski)**

### SOURCE

Author: kuczynski
Rows used: 1–3

---

## 1) CLUSTERS (from the third column)

### A. Mechanisms and Expectation

**T1.** Positing a mechanism that explains a pattern makes it rational to expect the pattern to continue.

### B. Critique of Hume

**T2.** Hume's argument assumes the legitimacy of the gambler's fallacy.

### C. Purpose of Explanation

**T3.** The purpose of explanation is to reduce what must be taken for granted.

---

## 2) CORE COMMITMENTS (most central theses)

* **C1:** Explanation must posit mechanisms that reduce what is taken for granted. (from T1 + T3)
* **C2:** Expectation without mechanism is not rational. (implied by T1)
* **C3:** Hume’s induction argument collapses because it treats non-mechanistic pattern-following as rational. (from T2 + T1)

---

## 3) DEPENDENCY MAP (what supports what)

* **T1 supports:** rationality of projection depends on mechanisms
* **T3 supports:** explanation-quality standard = “reduce taken-for-granted”
* **T2 attacks:** Hume’s reasoning by classifying it as gambler’s-fallacy reasoning
* **T1 + T2 jointly yield:** Hume’s argument is invalid because it assumes a non-mechanistic form of rational expectation

---

## 4) DERIVED CONSEQUENCES (things that follow if the model is true)

* **D1:** Pure enumerative induction is irrational unless it implicitly encodes a mechanism.
* **D2:** If you explicitly know there is no mechanism favoring an outcome, repetition gives no reason to expect recurrence.
* **D3:** “Uniformity of Nature” is not a rational principle unless it is treated as a mechanism postulate.

---

## 5) PRESSURE POINTS (where critics will attack)

* **P1:** “Mechanism” must be defined—otherwise the model risks circularity (“expectation is rational when mechanism exists; mechanism exists when expectation is rational”).
* **P2:** The view implies a strong anti-Hume position; critics will ask whether Hume can be reconstructed without gambler’s-fallacy assumptions.

---

## 6) ONE-LINE SUMMARY

**Rational expectation requires mechanism-based explanation; Hume’s induction argument fails because it assumes non-mechanistic pattern projection is legitimate.**

## 1) CLUSTERS WITH NUMBERED THESES (verbatim theses)

### A. Mechanisms and Expectation

**T1.** Positing a mechanism that explains a pattern makes it rational to expect the pattern to continue.

### B. Critique of Hume

**T2.** Hume's argument assumes the legitimacy of the gambler's fallacy.

### C. Purpose of Explanation

**T3.** The purpose of explanation is to reduce what must be taken for granted.

### D. Criterion for Good Explanation

**T4.** Better explanations leave fewer unexplained explainers.

### E. Explanation as Continuity

**T5.** Explanation consists in eliminating discontinuities.

### F. Criterion for Hypotheses

**T6.** A hypothesis that replaces observed discontinuities with unobserved ones is inferior.

### G. Types of Discontinuity

**T7.** Theoretical discontinuities (unprecedented law-violations) are as problematic as spatiotemporal ones.

---

### H. Relational Probability

**T8.** Probability is relational: it describes bearing between evidence and hypothesis.

### I. Evidence-Relativity

**T9.** The same statement can be probable relative to one body of evidence and improbable relative to another.

### J. Probability and Ignorance

**T10.** An omniscient being would never use probability statements.

### K. Objectivity of Confirmation

**T11.** The degree to which evidence confirms a hypothesis is mind-independent.

### L. Probability vs Belief

**T12.** Being more worthy of belief than its negation doesn't make something worthy of belief.

---

### M. Argument for Materialism

**T13.** Mind affects body; anything that affects the physical is physical.

### N. Phenomenal Argument for Dualism

**T14.** Our experiences seem utterly unlike brain states.

### O. Puzzle of Qualia

**T15.** If experiences are brain states, we experience them as different from how they are; but we can't experience experiences.

### P. Critique of Dual Aspect

**T16.** Dual aspect theory requires something neither mental nor physical; this is incoherent.

### Q. Rejection of Eliminativism

**T17.** Eliminativism is a "hideous monstrosity"; of course pains exist.

### R. Critique of Behaviorism

**T18.** Behaviorism falsely reduces mental states to behavioral dispositions.

### S. Role of Background States

**T19.** How you respond depends on background mental states, not just input.

### T. Critique of Functionalism

**T20.** Functionalism says being a pain is having certain causes and effects; but pains are what they feel like.

### U. Against Functional Constitution

**T21.** A pain's causal role is a consequence of being a pain, not constitutive of it.

### V. Problem of Shared Content

**T22.** No two people's beliefs have exactly the same causal roles; functionalism can't account for shared content.

### W. Functionalism and Causation

**T23.** If being a belief that P = causing certain behaviors, then the belief can't cause those behaviors.

### X. Epiphenomenalism Problem

**T24.** Functionalism strips mental states of causal powers; this contradicts obvious facts.

### Y. Irreducible Materialism

**T25.** Materialism is probably correct, but mental truths resist reduction to physical truths.

---

### Z. Definition of Thing

**T26.** A thing is a prediction-enabling complex of events.

### AA. Degrees of Thinghood

**T27.** Thinghood comes in degrees; some things provide broader prediction bases than others.

### AB. Essence of Thinghood

**T28.** Dynamic integrity (maintaining prediction-enabling structure over time) is the essence of thinghood.

### AC. Non-Things

**T29.** An event-complex that is predictively inert is a non-thing to that extent.

### AD. Conjugate Relation

**T30.** Prediction and explanation are conjugates; explanation goes from effect to cause, prediction from cause to effect.

### AE. Thinghood vs Solidity

**T31.** Stars are as thingy as rocks despite being gaseous; solidity is not required for thinghood.

### AF. Contextual Thinghood

**T32.** Thinghood is relative to explanatory context; a galaxy can be thing-like for large-scale astronomy.

### AG. Mind-Independence of Things

**T33.** Things are not created by our explanations; a system can be thing-like in some contexts and not others.

### AH. Persistence as Causal Series

**T34.** Objects are causal series; numerical identity requires causal continuity between stages.

### AI. Causal Continuity Requirement

**T35.** If a causal series is severed, the object ceases to exist.

### AJ. Duplication vs Identity

**T36.** An exact duplicate not causally continuous with the original is not numerically identical.

### AK. Against Time Travel

**T37.** Discontinuous time travel is logically false; gaps in causal series mean annihilation and creation.

### AL. Against Backward Time Travel

**T38.** Backward time travel is logically impossible.

---

## 2) CORE COMMITMENTS (what everything hangs on)

**C1. Explanation = discontinuity elimination + reduction of what must be taken for granted.**
(from T3, T4, T5)

**C2. Legitimate induction requires mechanism; otherwise it’s gambler’s fallacy.**
(from T1, T2)

**C3. Probability is an objective bearing relation between evidence and hypothesis, not a mental state.**
(from T8, T9, T10, T11)

**C4. Materialism is true because mental causation is real; but reduction fails.**
(from T13, T14, T15, T25)

**C5. Thinghood = prediction-enabling dynamic integrity; identity = causal continuity.**
(from T26–T38)

---

## 3) DEPENDENCY MAP (how the clusters connect)

### Explanation ↔ Induction

* **T1 depends on:** explanation/expectation link (T30)
* **T2 depends on:** T1 as the standard of rational expectation
* **T3–T7 set:** what counts as a good explanation, therefore what counts as a legitimate “mechanism”

### Explanation ↔ Probability

* Probability claims (T8–T12) give a framework for measuring support for explanatory hypotheses (T3–T7) without making probability subjective.

### Mind-Body ↔ Explanation

* Materialism argument (T13) is itself an explanatory constraint: anything with causal power belongs in the physical inventory.
* Qualia pressure (T14–T16) creates explanatory discontinuity if handled poorly; eliminativism is rejected (T17).

### Thinghood ↔ Explanation/Prediction

* Thinghood (T26–T33) is defined explicitly in terms of prediction and explanation (T30).
* Persistence/identity and anti-time-travel results (T34–T38) follow from causal-series ontology.

---

## 4) DERIVED CONSEQUENCES (must appear)

### From Mechanism + Explanation axioms (T1–T7)

**D1.** Pure pattern repetition gives no rational expectation unless it supports a mechanism.
**D2.** Hypotheses that add occult discontinuities are automatically downgraded.
**D3.** “Laws violated once” is as much a discontinuity as “teleportation across space-time.”

### From Probability axioms (T8–T12)

**D4.** Probability statements are always implicitly “relative to evidence E.”
**D5.** “More likely than not” is not enough for belief; belief requires certainty-standard.
**D6.** Omniscience implies no probability-talk; probability is an epistemic tool.

### From Mind-body axioms (T13–T25)

**D7.** If mental states cause physical effects, then mental states are physical (by the criterion).
**D8.** Functionalism implies epiphenomenalism; therefore functionalism is false if mental causation is real.
**D9.** Materialism is the best ontology but must be non-reductive.

### From Thinghood + Identity axioms (T26–T38)

**D10.** Solidity is irrelevant to thinghood; dynamic integrity is what matters.
**D11.** Identity is destroyed by causal discontinuity, so “time travel with gaps” is just annihilation + duplication.
**D12.** Backward time travel is logically impossible because it would require causal series inconsistency.

---

## 5) PRESSURE POINTS (must appear)

### Pressure points in Explanation cluster

**P1.** “Discontinuity” must be operationalized or the standard risks vagueness.
**P2.** The claim that “better explanations leave fewer unexplained explainers” needs a rule for counting “explainers.”

### Pressure points in Probability cluster

**P3.** The belief/credence distinction is extreme; critics will argue belief can be graded.
**P4.** “Mind-independent confirmation” will face Bayesian/subjectivist pushback.

### Pressure points in Mind-body cluster

**P5.** “Anything that affects the physical is physical” is a strong principle; dualists will reject it as question-begging.
**P6.** The qualia argument (T14–T15) pressures any physicalist story; without a positive account, the position looks like “forced materialism.”

### Pressure points in Thinghood/Identity cluster

**P7.** “Prediction-enabling” may seem epistemic rather than metaphysical; critics may say thinghood becomes observer-relative.
**P8.** The anti-time-travel argument depends on strict identity = causal continuity; critics may challenge that criterion.

---

## 6) ONE-LINE SUMMARY

**Good explanation eliminates discontinuities and minimizes unexplained explainers; rational expectation requires mechanism; probability is an objective evidence-relation; materialism is true but irreducible; and things/identity are causal-series structures, making discontinuous time travel logically impossible.**

---

## HARD CONSTRAINTS FOR THE MODEL BUILDER (must follow)

1. **Every thesis must appear verbatim, numbered, and grouped by the third-column label.**
2. **No filler prose.** No “we will now,” no generic background.
3. **Must include: core commitments, dependency map, derived consequences, pressure points, and one-line summary.**
4. **Derived consequences must be explicitly marked as derived, not presented as original input.**
5. **The output must be auditably traceable to the input.**
