## I. THEOLOGY / THE NATURE OF GOD (50 Contentions)

1. God is the Unmoved Mover—that which causes motion without itself being moved.
2. The Unmoved Mover is eternal and imperishable.
3. God is pure actuality (energeia) with no potentiality whatsoever.
4. Since potentiality implies change, and God has no potentiality, God cannot change.
5. God is immaterial, having no body or extension.
6. The divine substance is thinking (noesis).
7. God's activity is self-contemplation—thought thinking itself (noesis noeseos).
8. Divine thought has itself as its object because the divine mind and its object must be identical.
9. God does not think about the world, for this would make God dependent on something inferior.
10. God is the most excellent being, and the most excellent activity is contemplation; therefore God contemplates.
11. God's life is eternally active contemplation, the highest form of existence.
12. God is living, since life belongs to whatever has the activity of thought.
13. God possesses life in the highest degree, being eternally alive.
14. God is supremely good, being pure actuality of the best kind.
15. God is the final cause of all cosmic motion—things move toward God as toward their end.
16. God moves the cosmos as an object of desire moves a desirer—by being loved, not by mechanical action.
17. The heavens move eternally in imitation of divine perfection.
18. God does not deliberate or make choices, for deliberation implies incompleteness.
19. God has no emotions, since emotions involve bodily change and potentiality.
20. God is not benevolent toward humans in any personal sense.
21. God does not answer prayers or intervene in human affairs.
22. God has no memory, since memory pertains to what has passed and implies temporal change.
23. God has no anticipation of the future, since anticipation implies incompleteness.
24. Divine thought is identical with its object; in God, knower and known are one.
25. There is only one Unmoved Mover, since if there were many, the cosmos would lack unity.
26. God is numerically one and unique, not a species with multiple instances.
27. God is simple, having no composition of matter and form.
28. God has no genus, since genus implies potentiality for differentiation.
29. God cannot be defined in the ordinary sense, since definition requires genus and differentia.
30. God is necessary being—it is impossible for God not to exist.
31. God's existence is self-explanatory and requires no external cause.
32. The existence of eternal motion proves the existence of an eternal mover.
33. Without an Unmoved Mover, there would be no explanation for why anything moves.
34. God is the principle (arche) of all things, that on which all else depends.
35. God is separate from sensible things, being purely intelligible.
36. God is not in space, since only bodies occupy space.
37. God is not in time, since time is the measure of motion and God does not move.
38. God's eternity is not infinite duration but timeless actuality.
39. God is perfect, lacking nothing and requiring nothing.
40. God's perfection makes God entirely self-sufficient.
41. The divine intellect is always in the state that human intellect achieves only momentarily.
42. Human contemplation is a participation in divine activity.
43. God is that for the sake of which the heavens revolve eternally.
44. The celestial spheres are moved by intelligences (subordinate unmoved movers).
45. There are 47 or 55 unmoved movers corresponding to celestial spheres, but one supreme Unmoved Mover.
46. The Prime Mover is located (metaphorically) at the outermost celestial sphere.
47. God does not create the world, since the world is eternal.
48. The relationship between God and the world is not one of efficient causation but final causation.
49. Knowledge of God is the highest achievement of metaphysics (first philosophy).
50. Theology is the most honorable science, having the most honorable object.

## II. PHYSICS (20 Contentions)

1. Nature (physis) is an internal principle of motion and rest in things.
2. Natural things have their principle of motion within themselves; artificial things do not.
3. Motion (kinesis) is the actuality of potentiality qua potentiality.
4. There are four kinds of motion: substantial change (generation/corruption), qualitative change, quantitative change, and locomotion.
5. All motion requires a mover—nothing moves itself in the primary sense.
6. The infinite exists only potentially, never actually; there is no actual infinite magnitude.
7. Void (empty space) does not exist, since motion through void would have no determinate ratio.
8. Place is the innermost motionless boundary of the containing body.
9. Time is the number of motion with respect to before and after.
10. Time does not exist without motion, and motion does not exist without time.
11. Time requires a soul to count it, but motion exists independently.
12. Continuous magnitudes are infinitely divisible but not composed of indivisible points.
13. There is no first instant of motion, since every instant is a boundary, not a part.
14. The cosmos is finite in extent, bounded by the sphere of fixed stars.
15. There are two regions of the cosmos: the sublunary (subject to generation and corruption) and the superlunary (eternal and unchanging except for locomotion).
16. The natural motion of heavy bodies is toward the center; of light bodies, away from the center.
17. The four sublunary elements (earth, water, air, fire) have natural places to which they tend.
18. The celestial bodies are composed of a fifth element (aether) whose natural motion is circular.
19. Circular motion is prior to and more perfect than rectilinear motion.
20. Motion is eternal—there was no first moment of motion and will be no last.

---

## III. BIOLOGY (20 Contentions)

1. The soul is the first actuality of a natural body having organs.
2. Soul and body are related as form to matter, not as two separate substances.
3. Living things are distinguished from non-living by nutrition, growth, and reproduction.
4. There is a scala naturae—a continuous gradation from plants to animals to humans.
5. Plants possess only the nutritive soul; animals add sensation; humans add reason.
6. Reproduction serves to achieve immortality of the species, since individuals perish.
7. Sexual generation involves the male contributing form and the female contributing matter.
8. The male semen transmits the form; the female menstrual blood provides material substrate.
9. Spontaneous generation occurs for some lower organisms from putrefying matter.
10. Each organ exists for a purpose—nature does nothing in vain.
11. Function determines structure: organs are for the sake of their functions, not vice versa.
12. The heart is the central organ of the body, the seat of vital heat.
13. Blood is concocted in the heart and distributed through blood vessels.
14. The brain's function is to cool the blood, not to think.
15. Animals are classified by blood (blooded vs. bloodless), locomotion, and habitat.
16. Viviparous animals are more perfect than oviparous, which are more perfect than those producing larvae.
17. Teeth, horns, and other defensive structures are distributed according to nature's economy—no animal has both.
18. Dolphins and whales are not fish but a distinct kind of blooded animal (effectively mammals).
19. Some sharks are viviparous, giving birth to live young.
20. Development proceeds from the general to the specific—the heart forms first, then differentiation occurs.

---

## IV. PSYCHOLOGY (20 Contentions)

1. Psychology is the study of soul (psyche), which is the principle of life.
2. The soul is not separable from the body, except possibly the intellect.
3. To ask whether soul and body are one is like asking whether the wax and its shape are one.
4. Sensation is the reception of sensible forms without matter.
5. The sense organ must be potentially what the sensible object is actually.
6. Each sense has a proper object (color for sight, sound for hearing) and cannot err about it.
7. There are common sensibles (motion, rest, number, shape, magnitude) perceived by multiple senses.
8. The common sense unifies the deliverances of the five special senses.
9. Imagination (phantasia) is the movement produced by actual sensation.
10. Thinking requires images—the soul never thinks without an image (phantasm).
11. The passive intellect (nous pathetikos) is the capacity to receive intelligible forms.
12. The active intellect (nous poietikos) is that which makes all things intelligible, as light makes colors visible.
13. The active intellect is separable, impassible, unmixed, and eternal.
14. Memory is the possession of an image as a copy of that of which it is an image.
15. Recollection is the recovery of knowledge or sensation previously possessed.
16. Dreams are movements of sense-images occurring in sleep when the senses are inactive.
17. Desire (orexis) is the efficient cause of animal locomotion.
18. Practical reason alone does not produce action; desire must be present.
19. Pleasure is the unimpeded activity of a natural state.
20. Pain is the impediment of natural activity.

---

## V. POLITICS (20 Contentions)

1. Man is by nature a political animal (zoon politikon).
2. The polis exists by nature and is prior in nature to the individual.
3. One who lives outside the polis is either a beast or a god.
4. The state originates for the sake of life but exists for the sake of the good life.
5. The household is the natural unit from which the polis develops.
6. There are three relations in the household: master-slave, husband-wife, parent-child.
7. Some people are slaves by nature—those whose function is bodily service and who lack deliberative capacity.
8. Natural slavery is just and beneficial to both master and slave.
9. There are six forms of constitution: three correct (kingship, aristocracy, polity) and three deviant (tyranny, oligarchy, democracy).
10. Deviant constitutions serve the interest of the rulers; correct ones serve the common good.
11. The best practicable constitution for most states is polity—a mixture of oligarchy and democracy.
12. A large middle class is the foundation of political stability.
13. Extreme democracy and extreme oligarchy are both unstable.
14. Revolution occurs when those who are equal in one respect (e.g., free birth) demand equality in all respects.
15. Property should be private in ownership but common in use.
16. The purpose of the state is to enable citizens to live well, not merely to live.
17. Citizens properly so called are those who share in judicial and deliberative functions.
18. Education should be public and the same for all citizens.
19. The best life for both individual and state is the life of virtue sufficiently equipped with external goods.
20. Law is reason without passion; it is preferable to the rule of any individual.

---

## VI. EUDAIMONIA (20 Contentions)

1. Eudaimonia (happiness/flourishing) is the highest good, that for the sake of which all else is done.
2. Eudaimonia is activity of soul in accordance with virtue, in a complete life.
3. Eudaimonia is not a state but an activity—it consists in living and doing well.
4. Virtue alone is not sufficient for eudaimonia; external goods are also necessary.
5. A happy life requires a certain span of time; one swallow does not make a spring.
6. Children cannot be called eudaimon, since eudaimonia requires completed virtuous activity.
7. The eudaimon person can never become wretched, though great misfortunes may diminish happiness.
8. Eudaimonia is self-sufficient—it makes life desirable and lacking in nothing.
9. Pleasure accompanies eudaimonia but is not identical with it.
10. The pleasures proper to virtuous activity are the truest pleasures.
11. There are two kinds of virtue: intellectual (acquired by teaching) and moral (acquired by habituation).
12. The highest eudaimonia is the life of contemplation (theoria), exercising theoretical wisdom.
13. The secondary form of eudaimonia is the life of moral virtue and practical wisdom.
14. Contemplation is the highest activity because it is the most continuous, self-sufficient, and divine.
15. The gods live in perfect eudaimonia, which consists entirely in contemplation.
16. Human eudaimonia requires the virtues concerned with human affairs, but aspires to the divine.
17. Honor, wealth, and pleasure are not the good, though they may contribute to it.
18. The function (ergon) of man is rational activity; eudaimonia is the excellent performance of this function.
19. Eudaimonia is an objective condition, not merely a subjective feeling.
20. The happy person is one whose life manifests stable virtue and who is not buffeted by fortune.

---

## VII. EXPLANATION / CAUSES (20 Contentions)

1. To know something is to know its cause (aition); scientific knowledge is causal knowledge.
2. There are four causes: material, formal, efficient, and final.
3. The material cause is that out of which something comes to be and persists.
4. The formal cause is the essence or definition—what the thing is.
5. The efficient cause is the primary source of change or rest.
6. The final cause is that for the sake of which something is done—the end or purpose.
7. In natural things, the formal, efficient, and final causes often coincide.
8. Nature is a cause that operates for an end; natural processes are teleological.
9. Chance and spontaneity are incidental causes, parasitic on per se causes.
10. Necessity in nature is hypothetical: if the end is to be achieved, then certain means are necessary.
11. Scientific demonstration (apodeixis) proceeds from causes to effects.
12. The premises of demonstration must be true, primary, immediate, better known than, prior to, and causes of the conclusion.
13. There is no infinite regress of causes; demonstration rests on first principles.
14. First principles are known by nous (intellection), not by demonstration.
15. Different sciences have different first principles; there is no universal demonstrative science.
16. The most complete explanation cites all four causes.
17. Why-questions can be answered at different levels corresponding to different causes.
18. Mathematical objects have only formal causes; they have no matter, motion, or purpose.
19. Understanding requires grasping the universal in the particular—why this belongs to that.
20. Knowledge progresses from what is better known to us to what is better known by nature (the causes).

---

## VIII. LOGIC (20 Contentions)

1. Logic is the instrument (organon) of all sciences, not a substantive science itself.
2. A syllogism is discourse in which, certain things being stated, something other than what is stated follows of necessity.
3. Every syllogism consists of three terms: major, minor, and middle.
4. The middle term connects the major and minor terms and does not appear in the conclusion.
5. There are three figures of the syllogism, determined by the position of the middle term.
6. In the first figure, the middle is subject of the major premise and predicate of the minor.
7. The first figure is the most perfect; the other figures can be reduced to it.
8. Affirmative propositions have four forms: universal affirmative (A), universal negative (E), particular affirmative (I), particular negative (O).
9. Propositions are contradictory when one is the negation of the other; they cannot both be true or both be false.
10. Propositions are contrary when both cannot be true but both can be false.
11. A term is distributed when the proposition says something about the whole of its extension.
12. No valid syllogism has two negative premises or two particular premises.
13. If the premises are true and the syllogism valid, the conclusion must be true.
14. Demonstration is a syllogism productive of scientific knowledge.
15. Dialectic reasons from reputable opinions (endoxa), not from first principles.
16. Eristic reasoning aims at apparent victory, not truth.
17. Categories are the highest genera of being: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, passion.
18. Substance is the primary category; all others are predicated of or present in substances.
19. Definition states the essence through genus and differentia.
20. Predication is not symmetrical: "Socrates is a man" does not imply "Man is Socrates."

## IX. SCIENTIFIC CONTENTIONS THAT PROVED CORRECT OR HIGHLY ANTICIPATORY (20)

1. **Dolphins and whales are fundamentally different from fish** — Aristotle correctly classified cetaceans as a distinct group (effectively recognizing them as mammals based on live birth, lungs, and milk production).

2. **Some sharks are viviparous** — Confirmed; many shark species give birth to live young rather than laying eggs.

3. **The octopus has a complex nervous system and remarkable intelligence** — Aristotle described the octopus's sophisticated behavior; modern science confirms cephalopod intelligence.

4. **Embryological development proceeds from general to specific** — Von Baer's laws (1828) confirmed that embryos develop from undifferentiated to differentiated structures.

5. **The heart forms first in embryonic development** — Confirmed; the heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos.

6. **Catfish males guard the eggs** — Confirmed by modern ichthyology; many catfish species exhibit male parental care.

7. **The placental connection in certain sharks (galeus)** — Aristotle described a placenta-like structure in smooth dogfish; confirmed in 19th century as the yolk-sac placenta.

8. **Functional explanation in biology is legitimate** — Teleological explanation (what is the function of X?) remains central to biology despite mechanistic reductions.

9. **Classification should be based on multiple characters, not single features** — This polythetic approach anticipated modern taxonomy and cladistics.

10. **Hyenas are not hermaphrodites** — Aristotle correctly rejected the popular myth, identifying the unusual female genitalia as merely resembling male organs.

11. **Bees do not collect honey ready-made from flowers** — Aristotle recognized that bees transform nectar; this was not confirmed until the 18th century.

12. **The hectocotylus arm of cephalopods functions in reproduction** — Aristotle noted this specialized arm; its reproductive function was confirmed in the 19th century.

13. **Electric rays use electricity to stun prey** — Aristotle accurately described the numbing effect; electric organs were discovered much later.

14. **Ruminants have multiple stomach compartments** — Confirmed; Aristotle's observations of ruminant digestion were anatomically accurate.

15. **The cuttlebone provides buoyancy control** — Modern research confirms the cuttlebone regulates buoyancy through gas-liquid balance.

16. **Heavier bodies do not fall proportionally faster than lighter ones in the same medium** — In *De Caelo*, Aristotle notes that in a given medium, the ratio of speeds is not equal to the ratio of weights—anticipating Galileo's insight that in a vacuum all bodies fall equally.

17. **Nature is economical—organisms don't have superfluous parts** — This anticipates optimization principles in evolutionary biology.

18. **Species are real and stable but exhibit variation** — Aristotle held species-realism while acknowledging individual variation; this maps onto modern population thinking.

19. **The brain requires cooling** — While wrong about thinking, Aristotle was correct that the brain requires temperature regulation; hyperthermia damages neural function.

20. **Habituation is a form of learning distinct from conditioning** — Aristotle distinguished ethos (habit formation) from other learning; modern neuroscience recognizes habituation as a fundamental learning mechanism.
