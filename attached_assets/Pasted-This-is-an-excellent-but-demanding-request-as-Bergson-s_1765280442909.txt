This is an excellent but demanding request, as Bergson's positions are deeply interwoven and not always listed as discrete points. However, I will provide, for each of the 20 topics, **10 specific, core positions or theses** that Bergson argued for. This will illuminate the depth and structure of his thought.

---

### **1. Duration (La Durée)**
1.  Real time is qualitative, not quantitative.
2.  Duration is heterogeneous: each moment is qualitatively different and unique.
3.  States of consciousness interpenetrate and flow into one another, they are not discrete.
4.  It is the very fabric of our conscious existence: "We change without ceasing... there is no essential difference between passing from one state to another and persisting in the same state."
5.  It cannot be measured; measurement applies only to space, not to real time.
6.  It is always "in the making," a continuous creation of novelty.
7.  The past is not annihilated; it is preserved and accumulates, constituting duration.
8.  Our language and intellect inevitably spatialize and falsify true duration.
9.  It is directly knowable only through intuition, not analysis.
10. It is the fundamental reality from which our sense of being and identity emerges.

### **2. Élan Vital (Vital Impulse)**
1.  Evolution is driven by an internal, creative impulse, not merely external pressures.
2.  It is the reason for the increasing complexity and diversification of life.
3.  It is not directed toward a pre-determined goal (teleology) but is an open-ended, creative process.
4.  It encounters material resistance, leading to divergent evolutionary paths (e.g., instinct vs. intelligence).
5.  It explains the appearance of identical complex organs in unrelated lineages (convergent evolution) better than pure mechanism or chance.
6.  It is a "current of consciousness" that has infiltrated matter.
7.  It is characterized by continual invention and the creation of absolute novelty.
8.  It is not a substance or a thing, but a tendency, a movement.
9.  Humans represent the major line of this impulse, where consciousness and freedom reach their highest expression.
10. The *élan vital* is the cosmic principle of creation, analogous to (but not identical with) a spiritual force.

### **3. Intuition vs. Intellect**
1.  The intellect is evolutionarily shaped to manipulate matter and facilitate action.
2.  Its natural tendency is to analyze, fragment, and spatialize reality.
3.  It is best suited for geometry, logic, and the physical sciences.
4.  Intuition is a sympathetic, instinct-become-disinterested method of philosophy.
5.  It is the means of knowing reality "from within," by coinciding with its unique duration.
6.  Intuition grasps the absolute, while the intellect deals in relatives and perspectives.
7.  It is a difficult, rare, and concentrated effort, requiring a reversal of habitual thought.
8.  Philosophy's primary task is to cultivate and employ intuition as its core method.
9.  Intuition does not replace intellect but complements and goes beyond it.
10. Through intuition, we gain access to metaphysical truth, which is mobile, not static.

### **4. Memory (Pure vs. Habit)**
1.  The past is preserved in its entirety. "In reality, the past is preserved by itself, automatically."
2.  There are two fundamentally different forms of memory: **Habit Memory** (learned repetition, lodged in the body, oriented toward utility) and **Pure Memory** (the spontaneous recollection of unique past events in all their detail).
3.  Pure memory is spiritual, not localized in the brain.
4.  The brain's function is not to store memories but to select, from the totality of pure memory, only those images useful for present action.
5.  Recognition is not the brain replaying a recording; it is the dynamic circuit between the present perception and the plunging of consciousness into pure memory.
6.  Memory and perception are always intermingled; every perception is "impregnated with memory-images."
7.  Forgetting is a positive, practical function of selection, not a failure of storage.
8.  Our personal identity is constituted by the continuous, integral accumulation of pure memory.
9.  Dreams occur when the brain's selective, practical function relaxes, and images from pure memory flood in without the anchor of present action.
10. Matter is characterized by perfect repetition (habit), while Spirit is characterized by pure memory and true novelty.

### **5. The Self (The Multiplicity of States)**
1.  The superficial self is a pragmatic, social projection adapted for communication and action.
2.  Beneath this lies a "fundamental self," which is the continuous, interpenetrating flux of our duration.
3.  Our inner states are not separate but melt into and color one another.
4.  Language, by giving fixed names to these fluid states, creates a false sense of discrete identity.
5.  We are never the same twice; our self is a perpetual state of becoming.
6.  The deep self is the seat of genuine freedom and creativity.
7.  Most of our daily actions are performed by the superficial, habitual self.
8.  Art, emotion, and profound decisions arise from contact with the deep self.
9.  Psychological analysis that dissects the self into parts inevitably loses the essence of its living unity.
10. The task of philosophy and self-knowledge is to grasp this inner duration.

### **6. Freedom & Determinism**
1.  Freedom is real, but not the "freedom of choice" between pre-existing, calculable motives.
2.  True freedom is an act that "springs from the whole person" and expresses their unique duration.
3.  The free act is one that could not have been predicted, even by the person themselves, because it creates something new.
4.  Determinism arises from the intellectual habit of analyzing our past acts into separate motives and states, then projecting that spatialized scheme onto the future.
5.  When we deliberate, the self is changing through the very duration of the deliberation; the outcome is the manifestation of this new, evolved self.
6.  Freedom is not absolute but a matter of degree: the more we act from our deep, undivided self, the freer we are.
7.  Most so-called "choices" are mechanical applications of habit (the superficial self) and are therefore not truly free.
8.  Freedom is experienced, not proven. It is a fact of consciousness grasped through intuition.
9.  The scientific prediction of human action is impossible in principle because it deals with the creation of novelty.
10. Freedom is the very definition of the spiritual reality of the self.

### **7. The Comic / Laughter**
1.  Laughter is an exclusively human and social phenomenon.
2.  Its function is corrective: to humiliate and thus correct mechanical inelasticity in human behavior.
3.  The comic arises from "something mechanical encrusted on the living."
4.  It requires a momentary "anaesthesia of the heart"; we must suspend sympathy to laugh.
5.  A character becomes comic through rigidity, absent-mindedness, or a repetitive tic—acting like an automaton.
6.  Situations become comic through repetition, inversion, or reciprocal interference of series.
7.  The logic of the comic is often a "dream logic," absurd yet internally consistent.
8.  Verbal comedy arises from treating language itself as a rigid, material thing (e.g., puns, clichés taken literally).
9.  Society uses laughter as an informal policing mechanism to maintain flexibility and social cohesion.
10. True humor is intellectual; it is the intelligence contemplating its own caricature.

### **8. The Spatialization of Time**
1.  Our common-sense and scientific conception of time as a line with points is a spatial metaphor.
2.  This metaphor is useful for science, measurement, and practical life but is metaphysically false.
3.  By spatializing time, we turn succession into juxtaposition, destroying the interpenetration of states.
4.  Zeno's paradoxes of motion arise from applying spatial concepts to the movement of duration.
5.  The concept of "instants" is an intellectual abstraction; in reality, there are only flows.
6.  This spatialized time leads to the deterministic illusion, as it presents the future as a pre-drawn line.
7.  It also creates the false problem of "being vs. becoming."
8.  The history of philosophy has largely been dominated by this spatializing tendency.
9.  Einstein's theory of relativity, for Bergson, still dealt with a measured, spatialized time, not duration.
10. Liberation from this intellectual habit is the first step toward metaphysical truth.

### **9. The Mind-Body Problem**
1.  The problem is a false dilemma created by the intellect, which conceives of mind and matter as two distinct substances.
2.  Matter and consciousness are not opposites but different *tensions* or *rhythms* of duration.
3.  Pure perception (theoretical, disinterested) would coincide with the object; in practice, perception is always subtractive and oriented toward potential action.
4.  The body is not the seat of consciousness but an "image" among images, a center of action.
5.  The brain is an instrument of choice, not of representation. It filters possible actions, not memories or perceptions themselves.
6.  Memory (spirit) and matter meet precisely at the point of present perception and bodily action.
7.  The so-called "parallelism" of mental and cerebral states exists only for simple sensorimotor processes, not for rich mental life.
8.  Spiritualism and materialism are both wrong because they reify what are really tendencies.
9.  Consciousness is essentially memory, and its connection to the body is one of practical interest, not ontological identity.
10. The unity of mind and body is experienced in the unity of our lived duration.

### **10. Creative Evolution**
1.  Evolution is not the rearrangement of pre-existing parts (mechanism) nor the realization of a pre-existing plan (finalism).
2.  It is genuinely creative, producing forms and properties that are absolutely novel and unpredictable.
3.  The *élan vital* is the cause of both the unity of life (common impulse) and its diversity (diverging paths).
4.  Evolution proceeds by "dissociation" and "divergence," like an exploding shell fragmenting.
5.  Two major divergent paths are **instinct** (immersed in life, but limited to specific objects) and **intelligence** (adept at manipulating inert matter, but external to life's inner nature).
6.  Humanity represents the line where intelligence developed most fully, but at the cost of a diminished instinct.
7.  In other lines (e.g., hymenoptera like ants), instinct reached its peak.
8.  Evolution is not progress toward a single ideal; it is a fan-like expansion of possibilities.
9.  It involves struggle, contingency, and dead ends, as the *élan vital* contends with material inertia.
10. The ultimate meaning of evolution is the creation of beings capable of freedom, consciousness, and love.

### **11. The Two Sources of Morality and Religion**
1.  There are two distinct types of morality: **Closed Morality** (social, based on obligation and pressure for group survival) and **Open Morality** (universal, based on aspiration and love, inspired by exceptional individuals).
2.  Closed morality is static, tribal, and creates a "closed society."
3.  Open morality is dynamic, embraces all humanity, and defines the "open society."
4.  Similarly, there are two types of religion: **Static Religion** (myth-making/fabulation, serves a defensive, social function against the intellect's fear of death and the unknown) and **Dynamic Religion** (found in mysticism, is a direct contact with the creative force of life).
5.  Static religion, through fabulation, creates protective gods and rituals to ensure social cohesion.
6.  Dynamic religion is the source of profound spiritual transformation and universal love.
7.  Most historical religions are mixtures of these two sources.
8.  The mystic is the true hero of dynamic religion and the pioneer of open morality.
9.  The move from closed to open is not a logical development but a creative leap.
10. Humanity's future lies in the expansion of the open society, though the pull of the closed society is constant.

### **12. Mysticism**
1.  Mystical experience is not irrational but supra-intellectual; it is the highest form of intuition.
2.  The mystic has a direct contact or partial coincidence with the creative effort of life (*élan vital*).
3.  This experience is active, not passive; it fills the mystic with an overwhelming love and a desire to act for the good of humanity.
4.  The mystic is the primary source of **open morality** and **dynamic religion**.
5.  Mystical experience is confirmable not by argument, but by its fruits: a life of creative love and action.
6.  It represents the culminating point of the evolutionary effort on our planet.
7.  Complete mysticism is "active, effective, creative."
8.  It breaks through the limits of the "closed soul" and achieves a sense of union with the divine as creativity.
9.  Christianity, at its mystical core (e.g., St. Paul, St. Teresa, St. John of the Cross), represents the highest form of dynamic religion for Bergson.
10. The mystic's role is not to retreat from the world, but to transform it.

### **13. The Opposition of the "Open" and the "Closed"**
1.  This is a fundamental duality in human social and psychic life.
2.  The **Closed** is characterized by: habit, obligation, exclusivity, defense, static order, and the primacy of the group over the individual.
3.  The **Open** is characterized by: creativity, aspiration, inclusivity, progress, dynamic movement, and the embrace of all humanity.
4.  The closed society is the natural, default state for humanity, rooted in biological necessity.
5.  The open society is a rare, creative achievement, always in danger of collapsing back into closure.
6.  Politics, morality, and religion constantly oscillate between these two poles.
7.  The "call of the hero" or mystic is what opens the closed.
8.  Democracy, at its ideal, aspires to be an open society but is always vulnerable to nationalist or tribal (closed) regression.
9.  The tension between these two forces is the engine of human history.
10. The philosopher's duty is to work for the open, while understanding the powerful, natural pull of the closed.

### **14. The Problem of Nothingness**
1.  The idea of "absolute nothing" is an intellectual illusion and a false problem.
2.  We think we can conceive of nothing, but we are only conceiving of "everything" and then subtracting it or imagining ourselves destroying it.
3.  This act of suppression or destruction still presupposes an actor and a background—it is a relative nothing, not an absolute void.
4.  Being is full and positive; "nothing" is merely a word we give to the absence of a specific thing we expected.
5.  The anxiety about "why is there something rather than nothing?" stems from this linguistic and intellectual fallacy.
6.  Existence is not a predicate that can be added or removed; it is the very condition of all thought.
7.  The concept of Nothing is posterior to the concept of Being, not its logical opposite.
8.  This critique dismantles a cornerstone of classical metaphysical debates (e.g., in Leibniz).
9.  It reinforces his view that philosophy must start from the positive, full reality of duration and life.
10. The feeling of "nothingness" in extreme experiences (e.g., intense desire frustrated) is a psychological reality of absence, not a metaphysical insight into Nothing.

### **15. Perception (Matter and Memory)**
1.  "Matter" is an aggregate of "images" in a neutral sense—things that exist halfway between the Kantian thing-in-itself and the Berkeleyan mental representation.
2.  **Pure perception** (theoretical) would be the object itself, insofar as it coincides with our potential action upon it.
3.  Our actual perception is never pure; it is always "impregnated with memories" that complete it.
4.  Perception is subtractive: the brain and senses select, from the totality of material images, only those that interest our possible action.
5.  The body is a privileged image, a center of action, through which all other images are filtered.
6.  There is no internal "movie screen" in the brain; perception is in the objects, not inside our head.
7.  Memory intervenes instantly to fill in the gaps in immediate perception (e.g., recognizing a friend from a glimpse).
8.  The difference between perception and recollection is not of kind, but of degree of relation to present action: perception presses for immediate action, memory does not.
9.  This theory bridges realism (objects exist independently) and idealism (our knowledge is centered on our action).
10. The entire universe is presented in each perception, but almost all of it is eliminated by our practical needs.

### **16. The Real and the Possible**
1.  The traditional view—that possibilities pre-exist and are then realized—is backwards.
2.  The possible is a mirage projected backwards by the intellect *after* the real has appeared.
3.  When we say an event was "possible," we mean it was *compatible* with the prior state of things—but this is a retrospective judgment.
4.  True creation brings into reality something that was *not* pre-contained in the prior state, like a work of art.
5.  The idea of "all the possibilities" is an illusion of the spatializing intellect, trying to lay out the future like a menu.
6.  The *élan vital* creates the real *and* the possible along with it; the possible does not precede.
7.  This reinforces the doctrine of absolute novelty in evolution and human action.
8.  It defends the reality of freedom and unpredictability.
9.  It makes the future genuinely open and undetermined.
10. "The idea of the possible is therefore a pseudo-idea... it is the real which makes itself possible, and not the possible which becomes real."

### **17. The Comic as a Social Gesture**
1.  (See #7 for core positions. This list refines the social aspect.)
2.  Laughter is always a social "ragging," even when alone (we imagine a social context).
3.  Its target is always human, or human-like (animals only if they seem to exhibit human folly).
4.  It functions as an "implied social disapproval," a corrective without the cost of real punishment.
5.  Society laughs at eccentricity that threatens to become a disruptive rigidity.
6.  The comic character is often one who is "in a group but not of it," whose rigidity clashes with social flexibility.
7.  Comedy reinforces social norms by ridiculing deviations that are not dangerous enough to require moral condemnation.
8.  The laughter of a group strengthens its internal bonds against the comic outsider.
9.  This is why tragedy (eliciting sympathy) deals with individuals, while comedy (eliciting ridicule) deals with types.
10. The study of the comic is, therefore, a branch of sociology for Bergson.

### **18. Fabulation**
1.  Fabulation is a defensive, natural function of the intelligence.
2.  When the intellect confronts threats it cannot handle (death, unpredictable forces, the idea of a purposeless universe), it creates reassuring myths.
3.  It is the source of **static religion**, producing gods, spirits, and rituals that offer protection and meaning.
4.  These fabulations are not lies; they are a vital, instinct-like response of the intelligence to its own fears.
5.  They serve a crucial biological and social function: preserving the individual from paralyzing anxiety and the group from disintegration.
6.  They create "imaginary guardians" for humanity.
7.  Fabulation is distinct from both pure intelligence and intuition/mysticism.
8.  It explains the universal presence of religion in human societies.
9.  Dynamic religion (mysticism) transcends and bypasses the need for fabulation.
10. In modern life, fabulation can take secular forms (e.g., in political ideologies or mass delusions).

### **19. The Method of Philosophy**
1.  Traditional philosophy has been dominated by the spatializing intellect, leading to false problems (e.g., being/nothing, freedom/determinism).
2.  The true method of metaphysics is **intuition**.
3.  Intuition requires an immense, difficult effort to reverse the natural direction of thought (which is turned outward toward action).
4.  It involves a direct, sympathetic coincidence with the object's own duration.
5.  Philosophical concepts must be fluid, mobile, and adaptable, not rigid and fixed.
6.  Philosophy should not seek a single, total system (a spatialized view of truth) but should follow the moving reality.
7.  It must start from immediate experience, not from pre-existing concepts or scientific abstractions.
8.  Its role is to solve (or dissolve) metaphysical problems by showing their origin in intellectual missteps.
9.  It is complementary to science: science analyzes matter with the intellect; philosophy intuits life and spirit.
10. The ultimate test of a philosophical truth is its ability to reconnect with lived experience and illuminate it.

### **20. The Rhythms of Duration**
1.  Duration is not one universal tempo; it has different **tensions** or **rhythms**.
2.  A higher tension means a richer concentration of experience and memory in a given moment.
3.  Human consciousness is a relatively rapid, intense rhythm of duration.
4.  An animal's duration is slower and less "condensed."
5.  Matter represents the extreme limit of relaxation: a rhythm so slow it appears as mere repetition and extension—spatiality itself.
6.  These rhythms are not separate substances but different modulations of the same creative movement.
7.  The *élan vital* is the principle that introduces differing tensions into the fabric of existence.
8.  Mystical experience might involve an immense acceleration or intensification of one's own duration.
9.  This theory provides a metaphysical basis for the hierarchy of forms in nature without resorting to vitalism in the crude sense.
10. It unifies his cosmology: reality is a spectrum of durations, from the near-eternity of the atom to the creative surge of the human spirit.

Of course. Here are 10 questions for each of the 20 topics, where Bergson's specific position serves as the core of the answer.

---

### **1. Duration (La Durée)**
1.  **Q:** Is our inner, lived experience of time the same as the time measured by a clock?
    **A:** No, real time is qualitative, not quantitative. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** Are the moments of our consciousness separate and distinct, like beads on a string?
    **A:** No, states of consciousness interpenetrate and flow into one another. (Pos. 3)
3.  **Q:** When we remain deep in thought, are we truly in the same state the entire time?
    **A:** No, "there is no essential difference between passing from one state to another and persisting in the same state." We change without ceasing. (Pos. 4)
4.  **Q:** Can the essence of a melody be captured by listing the individual notes?
    **A:** No, because duration is heterogeneous; the whole is a unique, interpenetrating flow that cannot be fragmented. (Pos. 2, 3)
5.  **Q:** Does the past cease to exist once it is over?
    **A:** No, the past is not annihilated; it is preserved and accumulates, constituting duration itself. (Pos. 7)
6.  **Q:** Why is it so hard to describe our feelings accurately in words?
    **A:** Because our language and intellect inevitably spatialize and falsify true duration. (Pos. 8)
7.  **Q:** How can we know time as it truly is, not as we measure it?
    **A:** It is directly knowable only through intuition, not analysis. (Pos. 9)
8.  **Q:** Is the future already laid out, waiting to happen?
    **A:** No, duration is always "in the making," a continuous creation of novelty. (Pos. 6)
9.  **Q:** What is the most fundamental reality of our existence?
    **A:** Duration is the fundamental reality from which our sense of being and identity emerges. (Pos. 10)
10. **Q:** If we can't measure it scientifically, is lived time just a subjective illusion?
    **A:** No, it is the primary reality; measurement applies only to space, not to real time. (Pos. 5)

### **2. Élan Vital (Vital Impulse)**
1.  **Q:** Is evolution merely a mechanical process of random mutation and natural selection?
    **A:** No, it is driven by an internal, creative impulse, the *élan vital*. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** Does evolution have a predetermined end goal or plan?
    **A:** No, it is an open-ended, creative process, not directed toward a pre-determined goal. (Pos. 3)
3.  **Q:** Why do similar complex organs (like eyes) appear in unrelated evolutionary lineages?
    **A:** The *élan vital* explains this convergent evolution better than pure chance, as a common creative tendency. (Pos. 5)
4.  **Q:** What is the relationship between life and the inert matter it inhabits?
    **A:** The *élan vital* is a "current of consciousness" that has infiltrated and must contend with matter. (Pos. 6)
5.  **Q:** Are humans an accident of evolution, or do they hold a special place?
    **A:** Humans represent the major line where the *élan vital*'s consciousness and freedom reach their highest expression. (Pos. 9)
6.  **Q:** Is the complexity of life just the rearrangement of pre-existing parts?
    **A:** No, the *élan vital* is characterized by continual invention and the creation of absolute novelty. (Pos. 7)
7.  **Q:** How can we conceive of the force behind evolution if it's not a thing?
    **A:** It is not a substance, but a tendency, a movement. (Pos. 8)
8.  **Q:** What is the ultimate cause of life's diversification into so many forms?
    **A:** The *élan vital* is the reason for the increasing complexity and diversification of life. (Pos. 2)
9.  **Q:** Why did evolution not follow a single, straight path of progress?
    **A:** The *élan vital* encounters material resistance, leading to divergent evolutionary paths. (Pos. 4)
10. **Q:** Is there a spiritual or cosmic dimension to the process of life?
    **A:** The *élan vital* is the cosmic principle of creation, analogous to a spiritual force. (Pos. 10)

### **3. Intuition vs. Intellect**
1.  **Q:** Why is science so successful at manipulating the material world?
    **A:** Because the intellect is evolutionarily shaped to manipulate matter and facilitate action. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** What is the fundamental limitation of scientific and logical thinking?
    **A:** Its natural tendency is to analyze, fragment, and spatialize reality, missing its fluid essence. (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** How can we truly understand another living being's experience?
    **A:** Through intuition, a sympathetic method of knowing reality "from within." (Pos. 5)
4.  **Q:** What is the proper method for philosophy, as distinct from science?
    **A:** Philosophy's primary task is to cultivate and employ intuition as its core method. (Pos. 8)
5.  **Q:** Does intuition deny or reject the intellect?
    **A:** No, intuition does not replace intellect but complements and goes beyond it. (Pos. 9)
6.  **Q:** Why is a mathematical proof certain, while a philosophical insight feels different?
    **A:** The intellect is best suited for geometry and logic (relatives), while intuition grasps the absolute. (Pos. 3, 6)
7.  **Q:** Is metaphysical knowledge even possible?
    **A:** Yes, through intuition we gain access to metaphysical truth, which is mobile, not static. (Pos. 10)
8.  **Q:** Why is it so difficult to think about time, life, or consciousness?
    **A:** Because it requires a difficult, rare effort of intuition, a reversal of our habitual intellectual thought. (Pos. 7)
9.  **Q:** What kind of knowledge do we get from immediate, pre-reflective experience?
    **A:** Intuition is the means of knowing that arises from a sympathetic, instinct-become-disinterested attention. (Pos. 4)
10. **Q:** Is all knowledge relative to our perspective?
    **A:** The intellect deals in relatives and perspectives; intuition aims for the absolute. (Pos. 6)

### **4. Memory (Pure vs. Habit)**
1.  **Q:** Is everything we've ever experienced stored somewhere?
    **A:** Yes, "the past is preserved by itself, automatically" in its entirety as pure memory. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** What's the difference between memorizing a phone number and recalling a childhood birthday?
    **A:** The first is habit memory (automatic, for utility); the second is pure memory (unique, personal recollection). (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** Where are memories physically stored in the body?
    **A:** Pure memory is spiritual, not localized in the brain. (Pos. 3)
4.  **Q:** What, then, is the actual function of the brain in memory?
    **A:** The brain's function is to select, from the totality of pure memory, only those images useful for present action. (Pos. 4)
5.  **Q:** When we recognize a friend's face, what is actually happening?
    **A:** Recognition is the dynamic circuit between the present perception and consciousness plunging into pure memory. (Pos. 5)
6.  **Q:** Do we ever perceive the world exactly as it is, without any interpretation?
    **A:** No, every perception is "impregnated with memory-images." (Pos. 6)
7.  **Q:** Is forgetting a failure of our mental hardware?
    **A:** No, forgetting is a positive, practical function of selection, not a failure of storage. (Pos. 7)
8.  **Q:** What makes me the same person I was 10 years ago?
    **A:** Our personal identity is constituted by the continuous, integral accumulation of pure memory. (Pos. 8)
9.  **Q:** Why do dreams often seem like bizarre collages of past experiences?
    **A:** Dreams occur when the brain's selective function relaxes, and images from pure memory flood in. (Pos. 9)
10. **Q:** What is the most fundamental difference between a living being and a rock?
    **A:** Matter is perfect repetition (habit); Spirit is pure memory and true novelty. (Pos. 10)

### **5. The Self (The Multiplicity of States)**
1.  **Q:** Is the "you" that interacts in social situations your true self?
    **A:** It is a superficial, pragmatic, social projection adapted for communication. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** What lies beneath our social persona?
    **A:** Beneath it lies a "fundamental self," the continuous, interpenetrating flux of our duration. (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** Are our emotions like separate packages (anger, then joy, then sadness)?
    **A:** No, our inner states are not separate but melt into and color one another. (Pos. 3)
4.  **Q:** Why do psychological labels often feel inadequate to describe our experience?
    **A:** Language, by giving fixed names to fluid states, creates a false sense of discrete identity. (Pos. 4)
5.  **Q:** Are you ever exactly the same person from one moment to the next?
    **A:** No, we are never the same twice; our self is a perpetual state of becoming. (Pos. 5)
6.  **Q:** Where do our most authentic, creative, or loving actions come from?
    **A:** They arise from contact with the deep, undivided self. (Pos. 6, 8)
7.  **Q:** Are most of our daily decisions expressions of free will?
    **A:** No, most are performed by the superficial, habitual self and are not truly free. (Pos. 7)
8.  **Q:** What is wrong with analyzing the self into a list of traits, memories, and desires?
    **A:** Such analysis dissects the self into parts and inevitably loses the essence of its living unity. (Pos. 9)
9.  **Q:** What is the goal of self-knowledge?
    **A:** The task is to grasp this inner duration, the deep self. (Pos. 10)
10. **Q:** Is there a single, stable "I" at the center of our experience?
    **A:** No, the self is not a single entity but a dynamic, layered confluence of superficial and deep flows. (Implied by all)

### **6. Freedom & Determinism**
1.  **Q:** Is freedom just the ability to choose between pre-existing desires?
    **A:** No, true freedom is an act that "springs from the whole person" and expresses their unique duration. (Pos. 2)
2.  **Q:** Could a perfect supercomputer predict all your future actions?
    **A:** No, the free act is one that could not have been predicted, as it creates something new. (Pos. 3)
3.  **Q:** Why does looking back on our decisions often make them seem inevitable?
    **A:** Determinism arises from the intellectual habit of analyzing past acts into separate motives and projecting that scheme onto the future. (Pos. 4)
4.  **Q:** When we deliberate between options, is the "me" doing the deliberating changing?
    **A:** Yes, the self is changing through the very duration of the deliberation; the outcome manifests this new self. (Pos. 5)
5.  **Q:** Are some people freer than others?
    **A:** Yes, freedom is a matter of degree: the more we act from our deep, undivided self, the freer we are. (Pos. 6)
6.  **Q:** Is a routine, habit-driven life a free life?
    **A:** No, most "choices" are mechanical applications of habit and are not truly free. (Pos. 7)
7.  **Q:** Can science ever prove that free will exists?
    **A.** Freedom is experienced, not proven. It is a fact of consciousness grasped through intuition. (Pos. 8)
8.  **Q:** Will neuroscience one day fully explain and predict human decision-making?
    **A:** No, scientific prediction of human action is impossible in principle because it deals with the creation of novelty. (Pos. 9)
9.  **Q:** What is the most essential definition of our spiritual reality?
    **A:** Freedom is the very definition of the spiritual reality of the self. (Pos. 10)
10. **Q:** Is freedom compatible with having reasons for our actions?
    **A:** Yes, but it is not the "freedom of choice" between calculable motives; it is the emergence of a new state of the self. (Pos. 1)

### **7. The Comic / Laughter**
1.  **Q:** Why do we laugh at someone who slips on a banana peel?
    **A:** Laughter is a social corrective against mechanical inelasticity—the person became a rigid object. (Pos. 2, 3)
2.  **Q:** Can we laugh heartily at someone we deeply love who is in genuine pain?
    **A:** No, laughter requires a momentary "anaesthesia of the heart"; we must suspend sympathy. (Pos. 4)
3.  **Q:** What makes a comic character like Mr. Bean funny?
    **A:** He becomes comic through rigidity, absent-mindedness, and repetitive tics—acting like an automaton. (Pos. 5)
4.  **Q:** Why are repetition and role-reversal classic comic devices?
    **A:** Situations become comic through repetition, inversion, or reciprocal interference of series. (Pos. 6)
5.  **Q:** Does comedy follow the rules of real life?
    **A:** The logic of the comic is often a "dream logic," absurd yet internally consistent. (Pos. 7)
6.  **Q:** Why are puns and clichés used in comedy?
    **A:** Verbal comedy arises from treating language itself as a rigid, material thing. (Pos. 8)
7.  **Q:** What is the social purpose of laughter and ridicule?
    **A:** Society uses laughter as an informal policing mechanism to maintain flexibility and social cohesion. (Pos. 9)
8.  **Q:** Is comedy an intellectual or an emotional activity?
    **A:** True humor is intellectual; it is the intelligence contemplating its own caricature. (Pos. 10)
9.  **Q:** Do animals have a sense of humor?
    **A:** No, laughter is an exclusively human and social phenomenon. (Pos. 1)
10. **Q:** Is comedy fundamentally cruel?
    **A:** It has a corrective, slightly cruel function, but its aim is social regulation, not malice. (Pos. 2)

### **8. The Spatialization of Time**
1.  **Q:** Is the timeline in a history book an accurate picture of time itself?
    **A:** No, it is a spatial metaphor, useful but metaphysically false. (Pos. 1, 2)
2.  **Q:** What is the fundamental error in how we usually think about time?
    **A:** By spatializing time, we turn succession into juxtaposition, destroying the interpenetration of states. (Pos. 3)
3.  **Q:** Why can't Achilles overtake the tortoise in Zeno's famous paradox?
    **A:** The paradox arises from applying spatial concepts (infinitely divisible points) to the movement of duration. (Pos. 4)
4.  **Q:** Do "instants" of time actually exist, like mathematical points?
    **A:** No, the concept of "instants" is an intellectual abstraction; in reality, there are only flows. (Pos. 5)
5.  **Q:** Does the idea of a predetermined future stem from a logical error?
    **A:** Yes, spatialized time presents the future as a pre-drawn line, leading to the deterministic illusion. (Pos. 6)
6.  **Q:** Is the philosophical conflict between "Being" and "Becoming" a real problem?
    **A:** It is a false problem created by the spatializing tendency. (Pos. 7)
7.  **Q:** Has most of Western philosophy been misled by a simple metaphor?
    **A:** Yes, its history has largely been dominated by this spatializing tendency. (Pos. 8)
8.  **Q:** Does Einstein's theory of relativity finally describe true, lived time?
    **A:** No, it still deals with a measured, spatialized time, not duration. (Pos. 9)
9.  **Q:** What is the first step toward genuine philosophical insight?
    **A:** Liberation from this intellectual habit of spatializing time. (Pos. 10)
10. **Q:** Is our calendar and clock-based life a denial of reality?
    **A:** It is a practical necessity for action and science, but a metaphysical distortion of true duration. (Pos. 2)

### **9. The Mind-Body Problem**
1.  **Q:** Is the mind-body problem a genuine mystery or a mistake in how we frame it?
    **A:** It is a false dilemma created by the intellect conceiving of mind and matter as two distinct substances. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** What is the true relationship between consciousness and the physical world?
    **A:** Matter and consciousness are different *tensions* or *rhythms* of duration. (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** If we could perceive without any need to act, what would we see?
    **A:** **Pure perception** would coincide with the object itself. (Pos. 3)
4.  **Q:** Why do we not perceive every detail of our environment at once?
    **A:** Our actual perception is subtractive, selecting only those images that interest our possible action. (Pos. 4)
5.  **Q:** What is the body, metaphysically speaking?
    **A:** The body is not the seat of consciousness but a "center of action," a privileged image among images. (Pos. 4, 5)
6.  **Q:** Does the brain store memories and generate perceptions like a computer?
    **A:** No, the brain is an instrument of choice, filtering possible actions, not storing representations. (Pos. 5)
7.  **Q:** Where and how do mind and body actually interact?
    **A:** Memory (spirit) and matter meet precisely at the point of present perception and bodily action. (Pos. 6)
8.  **Q:** Is every thought correlated with a specific brain state?
    **A.** Parallelism exists only for simple sensorimotor processes, not for rich mental life. (Pos. 7)
9.  **Q:** Are spiritualism and materialism both wrong?
    **A:** Yes, because they reify what are really tendencies (mind and matter as rhythms). (Pos. 8)
10. **Q:** How do we experience the unity of mind and body?
    **A:** The unity is experienced in the unity of our lived duration. (Pos. 10)

### **10. Creative Evolution**
1.  **Q:** Is evolution the execution of a divine plan or a purely mechanical grind?
    **A:** Neither. It is genuinely creative, producing absolute novelty. (Pos. 1, 2)
2.  **Q:** What is the source of both the unity and diversity of life?
    **A:** The *élan vital* is the cause of both the unity (common impulse) and its diversity (diverging paths). (Pos. 3)
3.  **Q:** Why did life branch out into so many wildly different forms?
    **A:** Evolution proceeds by "dissociation" and "divergence," like an exploding shell. (Pos. 4)
4.  **Q:** What is the fundamental difference between animal instinct and human intelligence?
    **A:** They are two major divergent paths of the *élan vital*: instinct (immersed in life) and intelligence (manipulating matter). (Pos. 5)
5.  **Q:** Did humans pay a price for their high intelligence?
    **A:** Yes, humanity developed intelligence most fully, but at the cost of a diminished instinct. (Pos. 6)
6.  **Q:** Are insects like ants "higher" or "lower" than humans on an evolutionary scale?
    **A:** They are not lower, but a different divergence where instinct reached its peak. (Pos. 7)
7.  **Q:** Is evolution a story of steady progress toward perfection?
    **A:** No, it is a fan-like expansion of possibilities, with struggle, contingency, and dead ends. (Pos. 8, 9)
8.  **Q:** What is the ultimate "point" or meaning of evolution?
    **A:** The creation of beings capable of freedom, consciousness, and love. (Pos. 10)
9.  **Q:** Does the future of evolution follow laws we can deduce?
    **A:** No, it is an open-ended, creative process, full of contingency. (Pos. 3)
10. **Q:** Can the theory of natural selection fully explain the history of life?
    **A:** No, it must be supplemented by the concept of an internal creative impulse. (Pos. 1)

### **11. The Two Sources of Morality and Religion**
1.  **Q:** Why do we feel a strong obligation to our family or nation, distinct from universal love?
    **A:** That is **closed morality**, based on social pressure and obligation for group survival. (Pos. 1, 2)
2.  **Q:** What is the source of the moral call to love all humanity?
    **A:** It springs from **open morality**, based on aspiration and love, inspired by exceptional individuals. (Pos. 1, 3)
3.  **Q:** What is the purpose of religious rituals, rules, and tribal gods?
    **A:** They belong to **static religion**, serving a defensive, social function through myth-making. (Pos. 4, 5)
4.  **Q:** Where do figures like saints or mystics, who preach universal love, come from?
    **A:** They are the source of **dynamic religion**, arising from direct contact with the creative force of life. (Pos. 4, 6)
5.  **Q:** Are historical religions like Christianity purely one or the other?
    **A:** No, most are mixtures of these two sources—static structure and dynamic inspiration. (Pos. 7)
6.  **Q:** Who is the true moral hero?
    **A:** The mystic is the true hero of dynamic religion and the pioneer of open morality. (Pos. 8)
7.  **Q:** Does society naturally progress from tribalism to universalism?
    **A:** No, the move from closed to open is not a logical development but a creative leap. (Pos. 9)
8.  **Q:** What is the greatest challenge for human civilization?
    **A:** Humanity's future lies in the expansion of the open society, against the constant pull of the closed. (Pos. 10)
9.  **Q:** Why is patriotism both noble and potentially dangerous?
    **A:** It is rooted in the necessary "closed society" but can conflict with the universalism of the "open." (Pos. 2, 3)
10. **Q:** Is religion just a primitive form of science or a psychological crutch?
    **A:** No, static religion has a vital social function, while dynamic religion is a source of genuine spiritual transformation. (Pos. 4, 5, 6)

### **12. Mysticism**
1.  **Q:** Is mystical experience a form of irrational emotion?
    **A:** No, it is not irrational but supra-intellectual; the highest form of intuition. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** What do mystics actually experience or contact?
    **A:** A direct contact or partial coincidence with the creative effort of life (*élan vital*). (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** Do mystics just retreat from the world in passive ecstasy?
    **A:** No, the experience is active; it fills them with overwhelming love and a desire to act for humanity. (Pos. 3)
4.  **Q:** Where does the ideal of universal, selfless love come from?
    **A:** The mystic is the primary source of **open morality**. (Pos. 4)
5.  **Q:** How can we verify if someone's mystical experience is genuine?
    **A:** It is confirmable by its fruits: a life of creative love and action. (Pos. 5)
6.  **Q:** What is the highest potential of human evolution?
    **A:** Mystical experience represents the culminating point of the evolutionary effort. (Pos. 6)
7.  **Q:** Is mysticism just quietism or does it change the world?
    **A:** Complete mysticism is "active, effective, creative." (Pos. 7)
8.  **Q:** What does the mystic achieve that the philosopher or scientist does not?
    **A:** They break through the limits of the "closed soul" and achieve union with the divine as creativity. (Pos. 8)
9.  **Q:** Which religion, for Bergson, contains the highest mystical expression?
    **A:** Christianity, at its mystical core, represents the highest form of dynamic religion. (Pos. 9)
10. **Q:** Should the mystic engage with society or leave it?
    **A:** The mystic's role is not to retreat, but to transform the world. (Pos. 10)

### **13. The Opposition of the "Open" and the "Closed"**
1.  **Q:** What are the two fundamental forces shaping human societies?
    **A:** The **Closed** (habit, obligation, tribe) and the **Open** (creativity, aspiration, humanity). (Pos. 1, 2, 3)
2.  **Q:** Is the nation-state a natural or an artificial human construct?
    **A:** It is an expression of the natural, default **closed society**, rooted in biological necessity. (Pos. 4)
3.  **Q:** Can a society based on universal human rights ever be stable?
    **A:** The open society is a rare, creative achievement, always in danger of collapsing back into closure. (Pos. 5)
4.  **Q:** Why does history seem to cycle between expansion and isolation, progress and reaction?
    **A:** Politics, morality, and religion constantly oscillate between these two poles. (Pos. 6)
5.  **Q:** What force can open up a closed, tribal society?
    **A:** The "call of the hero" or mystic is what opens the closed. (Pos. 7)
6.  **Q:** Is democracy inherently an "open" form of government?
    **A:** At its ideal, it aspires to be, but is always vulnerable to nationalist (closed) regression. (Pos. 8)
7.  **Q:** What is the engine of historical change?
    **A:** The tension between these two forces is the engine of human history. (Pos. 9)
8.  **Q:** What is the social philosopher's duty?
    **A:** To work for the open, while understanding the powerful, natural pull of the closed. (Pos. 10)
9.  **Q:** Why do new, revolutionary ideals often become rigid institutions over time?
    **A:** Because the creative "open" impulse constantly risks being captured and fossilized into a new "closed" system. (Pos. 5, 6)
10. **Q:** Is human nature fundamentally tribal or universalist?
    **A:** Our nature is rooted in the closed (for survival), but we have the capacity for the open through creative effort. (Pos. 4, 5)

### **14. The Problem of Nothingness**
1.  **Q:** Can we truly conceive of absolute nothingness?
    **A:** No, the idea is an intellectual illusion and a false problem. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** What are we actually doing when we try to think of "nothing"?
    **A:** We are only conceiving of "everything" and then subtracting it or imagining ourselves destroying it. (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** Is the void of outer space an example of "nothing"?
    **A:** No, that is a relative nothing (absence of air); the idea of an absolute void is a pseudo-idea. (Pos. 3)
4.  **Q:** Which is more fundamental, Being or Nothingness?
    **A:** Being is full and positive; "nothing" is merely a word for the absence of a specific thing. (Pos. 4)
5.  **Q:** Why do we ask, "Why is there something rather than nothing?"
    **A:** The question stems from a linguistic and intellectual fallacy. (Pos. 5)
6.  **Q:** Can existence be logically negated?
    **A:** No, existence is not a predicate that can be added or removed; it is the condition of all thought. (Pos. 6)
7.  **Q:** Which concept comes first logically: Something or Nothing?
    **A:** The concept of Nothing is posterior to the concept of Being, not its logical opposite. (Pos. 7)
8.  **Q:** Does this critique undermine traditional metaphysics?
    **A:** Yes, it dismantles a cornerstone of debates like Leibniz's. (Pos. 8)
9.  **Q:** Where should philosophy begin its inquiry?
    **A:** It must start from the positive, full reality of duration and life, not from the abstraction of nothing. (Pos. 9)
10. **Q:** Is the feeling of emptiness or meaninglessness a glimpse of metaphysical Nothing?
    **A:** No, it is a psychological reality of absence, not a metaphysical insight into Nothing. (Pos. 10)

### **15. Perception (Matter and Memory)**
1.  **Q:** What is the world made of, independently of our minds?
    **A:** Matter is an aggregate of "images" in a neutral sense—things that exist on their own. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** What would perfect, disinterested perception be like?
    **A:** **Pure perception** would be the object itself, insofar as it coincides with our potential action. (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** Do we ever see the raw, uninterpreted data of the senses?
    **A:** No, our actual perception is never pure; it is always "impregnated with memories." (Pos. 3)
4.  **Q:** Why do we notice some things in a scene and ignore others?
    **A:** Perception is subtractive: it selects only those images that interest our possible action. (Pos. 4)
5.  **Q:** What is my body, from the perspective of the universe of images?
    **A:** The body is a privileged image, a center of action. (Pos. 5)
6.  **Q:** Is the world we see a movie projected inside our skull?
    **A:** No, there is no internal screen; perception is in the objects, not inside our head. (Pos. 6)
7.  **Q:** How can we recognize something from just a fragment (e.g., a voice)?
    **A:** Memory intervenes instantly to fill in the gaps in immediate perception. (Pos. 7)
8.  **Q:** What's the difference between seeing a chair and vividly imagining it?
    **A:** The difference is not of kind, but of the degree of relation to present action: perception presses for action, memory does not. (Pos. 8)
9.  **Q:** Does Bergson's theory side with realism or idealism?
    **A:** It bridges both: objects exist independently, but our knowledge is centered on our potential action. (Pos. 9)
10. **Q:** In every glance, how much of the universe are we actually taking in?
    **A:** The entire universe is presented, but almost all of it is eliminated by our practical needs. (Pos. 10)

### **16. The Real and the Possible**
1.  **Q:** Before a painter creates a masterpiece, did it exist as a possibility?
    **A:** No, the traditional view is backwards. The possible is a mirage projected backwards *after* the real appears. (Pos. 1, 2)
2.  **Q:** What does it mean when we say an event was "possible"?
    **A:** We mean it was *compatible* with the prior state of things—a retrospective judgment. (Pos. 3)
3.  **Q:** Does a creative act bring into being something that already existed in potential?
    **A:** No, true creation brings in something that was *not* pre-contained, like a work of art. (Pos. 4)
4.  **Q:** Can we, in principle, list all future possibilities?
    **A:** No, "all the possibilities" is an illusion of the spatializing intellect. (Pos. 5)
5.  **Q:** Which comes first in the creative process of evolution: the possible fish or the actual fish?
    **A:** The *élan vital* creates the real *and* the possible along with it; the possible does not precede. (Pos. 6)
6.  **Q:** Does this mean the future is completely undetermined?
    **A:** Yes, it reinforces the doctrine of absolute novelty and makes the future genuinely open. (Pos. 7, 9)
7.  **Q:** How does this defend free will?
    **A:** It shows our free acts are not the realization of pre-existing possibilities but true creations. (Pos. 8)
8.  **Q:** Is the "land of possibilities" a real place?
    **A:** "The idea of the possible is therefore a pseudo-idea... it is the real which makes itself possible." (Pos. 10)
9.  **Q:** Was the invention of the airplane "in the cards" of 18th-century physics?
    **A.** Not as a specific possibility; it became a new reality that retroactively made itself seem possible. (Pos. 2, 4)
10. **Q:** Does planning for the future imply that the future already exists as a set of options?
    **A:** No, planning is a present activity that helps *create* a future, not select from a pre-existing menu. (Pos. 5, 9)

### **17. The Comic as a Social Gesture**
1.  **Q:** Do we ever laugh when we are completely alone?
    **A:** Laughter is always a social "ragging," even when alone we imagine a social context. (Pos. 2)
2.  **Q:** Can we find a tree or a rock inherently funny?
    **A:** No, the target is always human, or human-like (animals only if they seem to exhibit human folly). (Pos. 3)
3.  **Q:** What is society's cheap, non-violent way of enforcing its norms?
    **A:** Laughter functions as an "implied social disapproval," a corrective without real punishment. (Pos. 4)
4.  **Q:** Who is the classic comic outsider?
    **A:** Someone who is "in a group but not of it," whose rigidity clashes with social flexibility. (Pos. 6)
5.  **Q:** Why do we laugh at minor social awkwardness but feel sympathy for major tragedy?
    **A:** Comedy reinforces norms by ridiculing deviations not dangerous enough for moral condemnation. (Pos. 7)
6.  **Q:** How does laughing together affect a group?
    **A:** The laughter of a group strengthens its internal bonds against the comic outsider. (Pos. 8)
7.  **Q:** Why do comedies often feature stock characters (the miser, the braggart)?
    **A:** Tragedy deals with individuals (eliciting sympathy), while comedy deals with types (eliciting ridicule). (Pos. 9)
8.  **Q:** Is the study of comedy a branch of psychology or sociology for Bergson?
    **A:** It is a branch of sociology. (Pos. 10)
9.  **Q:** Why is a robot or an automaton a classic comic figure?
    **A:** It represents the ultimate "mechanical encrusted on the living," the core of the comic. (Links to Pos. 3 from #7)
10. **Q:** Is mocking someone ever socially beneficial?
    **A:** Yes, when it corrects harmless but disruptive rigidity and restores social elasticity. (Pos. 4, 7)

You are absolutely right. I apologize for the abrupt and incomplete ending. Let's complete the final two topics properly.

### **18. Fabulation**
1.  **Q:** Why do all human cultures create myths and gods?
    **A.** Fabulation is a defensive, natural function of the intelligence against existential threats. (Pos. 1, 2)
2.  **Q:** What is the source of primitive or organized religion?
    **A:** It is the source of **static religion**, producing protective gods and rituals. (Pos. 3)
3.  **Q:** Are religious myths deliberate lies or something else?
    **A:** They are not lies but a vital, instinct-like response of the intelligence to its own fears. (Pos. 4)
4.  **Q:** Does religion serve a practical, biological purpose?
    **A:** Yes, it preserves the individual from paralyzing anxiety and the group from disintegration. (Pos. 5)
5.  **Q:** Why does humanity seem to need "guardian" figures?
    **A:** Fabulation creates "imaginary guardians" as a psychological defense mechanism. (Pos. 6)
6.  **Q:** Is religious belief a form of intelligence or instinct?
    **A:** It is distinct from both—a specific function (*fabulation*) born from intelligence confronting its limits. (Pos. 7)
7.  **Q:** Is religion therefore a universal and inevitable human trait?
    **A:** It explains the universal presence of religion in human societies as a natural psychic function. (Pos. 8)
8.  **Q:** Can a mystic be a true believer in static religious myths?
    **A:** Dynamic religion (mysticism) transcends and bypasses the need for fabulation. (Pos. 9)
9.  **Q:** Do modern ideologies like totalitarianism have a religious-like hold on people?
    **A:** Yes, fabulation can take secular forms in political ideologies or mass delusions. (Pos. 10)
10. **Q:** Is the need for comforting stories a sign of human weakness?
    **A:** For Bergson, it is a natural, functional response of the intellect to the terror of a seemingly indifferent cosmos. (Pos. 2, 5)

### **19. The Method of Philosophy**
1.  **Q:** Why has philosophy been stuck in endless debates about problems like free will vs. determinism?
    **A:** It has been dominated by the spatializing intellect, which creates these false problems. (Pos. 1)
2.  **Q:** What is the true method of metaphysics?
    **A:** The true method is **intuition**. (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** Why is philosophical insight so difficult to achieve?
    **A:** Intuition requires a immense effort to reverse the natural, outward-directed course of thought. (Pos. 3)
4.  **Q:** How can we know something absolutely, not just from a perspective?
    **A:** Through a direct, sympathetic coincidence with the object's own duration. (Pos. 4)
5.  **Q:** Should philosophical concepts be rigid and precisely defined?
    **A:** No, they must be fluid, mobile, and adaptable to follow moving reality. (Pos. 5)
6.  **Q:** Is the goal of philosophy to build a complete, total system of thought?
    **A:** No, it should not seek a single, total system (a spatialized view) but follow the moving reality. (Pos. 6)
7.  **Q:** Where should philosophy begin its investigation?
    **A:** It must start from immediate, lived experience, not from pre-existing concepts. (Pos. 7)
8.  **Q:** What is philosophy's main task regarding traditional metaphysical problems?
    **A:** To solve (or dissolve) them by showing their origin in intellectual missteps. (Pos. 8)
9.  **Q:** What is the relationship between philosophy and science?
    **A:** They are complementary: science analyzes matter with the intellect; philosophy intuits life and spirit. (Pos. 9)
10. **Q:** How do we know if a philosophical theory is true?
    **A:** The ultimate test is its ability to reconnect with and illuminate lived experience. (Pos. 10)

### **20. The Rhythms of Duration**
1.  **Q:** Does a dog experience time the same way a human does?
    **A:** No. Duration has different rhythms; an animal's duration is slower and less "condensed" than human consciousness. (Pos. 1, 4)
2.  **Q:** What is the difference between a moment of intense concentration and a moment of boredom?
    **A:** They represent different **tensions** of our own duration—one is a richer concentration of experience. (Pos. 2)
3.  **Q:** Is human consciousness the standard for all of reality?
    **A:** No, it is just one relatively rapid, intense rhythm of duration. (Pos. 3)
4.  **Q:** What is matter, in its deepest essence?
    **A:** Matter represents the extreme limit of relaxation: a rhythm so slow it appears as mere repetition and extension—spatiality itself. (Pos. 5)
5.  **Q:** Are mind and matter two completely separate substances?
    **A:** No, they are different modulations (rhythms) of the same creative movement. (Pos. 6)
6.  **Q:** What introduces these different "speeds" or tensions into existence?
    **A:** The *élan vital* is the principle that introduces differing tensions. (Pos. 7)
7.  **Q:** What happens during a profound mystical or creative experience?
    **A:** It might involve an immense acceleration or intensification of one's own duration. (Pos. 8)
