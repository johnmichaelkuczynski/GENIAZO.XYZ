 MATH>Set Theory


 
  set theory
  Set operations follow rules {set theory}. Boolean-set algebras {algebra of sets} can be axiomatic
set theories. From sets, one can choose {selection, set} smaller sets {subset, selection}, without regard
for  sequence  or  order  {combination,  set}.  For  valid  set-theory  statements,  if  operations  union  and
intersection  interchange,  null  set  and  universal  set  interchange,  and  set  inclusions  reverse,  valid
statements result. Set inclusion can use only intersection and union, so statements do not need to have
set inclusion.
 
  set in mathematics
  Objects {member, set} {element, set} and events can be in groups {set, mathematics}. Sets
{well-defined set} can have membership criteria. Sets have numbers of members {cardinality, set}
{power, set} {size, set}, which can be specific, unspecific, or infinite.
  subsets
  Sets  can  have  parts  {subset,  set}.  Sets  can  split  into  mutually  exclusive  subsets  {partition,
subset}. Subsets {connected set} can have all set members that are not in union of two separated sets.
  union
  Sets can contain all members of two sets {union, set}. Union of set with empty set is the set.
Union of set with universal set is universal set. Union of relative complements is a set {symmetric
difference}.
  intersection
  Sets can contain all members shared by two sets {intersection, set}. Intersection of set with
empty set is empty set. Intersection of set with universal set is the set.
 
  Venn diagram
  Circles {Venn diagram} can be graphs that show set relations.
 MATH>Set Theory>Set Types


 
  universal set
  Sets {universal set}| can contain everything.
 
  empty set
  Sets {null set} {empty set} can contain nothing.
 
    countable set
  Sets {countable set} can be in one-to-one correspondence with positive-integer set.
 
  disjoint set
   Two  sets  {disjoint  set,  non-overlapping}  {non-overlapping  set}  can  have  no  members  in
common.
 
    equivalence class
  Sets {equivalence class} can include all number examples. Equivalence classes are typically
infinite sets. For example, the equivalence class of -2 can include all possible pairs of natural-number
subtractions {equivalence relation, class}: -2 = 0 - 2 = (0,2) and -2 = 1 - 3 = (1,3), and so on. Complex
numbers are equivalence classes of remainders of polynomials x / (x^2 + 1), where x is a real number.
 
  residue class
  All congruent integers form set {residue class, set}, [x]n or Zn.
 
MATH>Set Theory>Set Types>Interval


 
  closed set
  Sets {closed set, interval} can contain limit point at boundary.
 
  derived set
  Sets {derived set} can have other-set limit points.
 
  open set
  Sets {open set} can contain no boundary points and so have only interior points.
 
  perfect set
  All closed-set {perfect set} points can be at the limit.
 
MATH>Set Theory>Set Types>Ordered


 
    monotonic set
  Set systems {monotonic set} can have previous sets contained in next sets.
 
  ordered set
  Sets  {ordered  set}  can  have  elements  that  follow  trichotomy  and  transitivity  relations.  Sets
{partially ordered set} can have elements that follow trichotomy and transitivity relations. 
  reflexive set
  Relation between second coordinate and first coordinate can be same as relation between first
coordinate and second coordinate {reflexive set}.
 
    transitive set
  Relation between second coordinate and first coordinate can be from higher to lower {transitive
set}.
 
MATH>Set Theory>Set Types>Subset


 
    complement of subset
  Subsets {complement, set}| {absolute complement} can have all set members that do not belong
to another subset. Subsets {relative complement} can have set members that do not belong to another
subset and belong to third subset.
 
  coset
  Subsets {coset, subset} can contain products of one set element times all set elements.
 
  nested set
  Sets {nested set} {nest, set} can have one set inside the other.
 
  power set
  For a set, a set {power set} can contain all subsets. For n-element sets, power sets have 2^n
elements. Subset number is greater than set-member number.
 MATH>Set Theory>Axioms


 
    Foundation axiom
  Set theory does not allow sets {paradoxical set} that are elements of themselves {Foundation
axiom}.
 
    Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
  Set theories {Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory} {ZF set theory} can be axiomatic systems. Zermelo
set theory has no paradoxes but is not consistent.
  The empty set exists {axiom of empty set}. The empty set exists, so at least one set exists {axiom
of existence}. Sets with same elements are equal {axiom of extension} {axiom of extensionality}. For
two sets, another set exists that contains all and only elements of the two sets {axiom of union}. For
two sets, another set exists that has the two sets as only elements {axiom of pairing}. For a set, another
set exists whose elements are the subsets of the original set {axiom of powers} {axiom of power set}.
A set exists that has the empty set as an element and, if an element is in the set, the set that contains
only that element is an element in the set {axiom of infinity}.
  Non-empty sets contain at least one element, and the non-empty set and the set of any element
are disjoint sets {axiom of regularity}. For any set and any mapping, a subset of the set exists that has
as elements the domain of the mapping {axiom of separation}. For any set and any mapping, a set
exists that has as elements the range of the mapping over the original set's elements (as domain of
mapping) {axiom of replacement} {axiom of specification}. For any set, a mapping exists that chooses
one element of each subset (axiom of choice).
 
MATH>Set Theory>Axioms>Axiom Of Choice


 
  axiom of choice
  For  any  set,  a  mapping  exists  that  chooses  one  element  of  each  subset  {axiom  of  choice}
{Zermelo's axiom}. Elements are not in any other non-empty set, even if number of non-empty subsets
is infinite. Axiom of choice is independent of set theory. Zermelo set theory has no paradoxes but is not
consistent. If Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is consistent without axiom of choice, then ZF set theory is
consistent with axiom of choice.
 
    Banach-Tarski theorem
  Axiom of choice leads to unexpected consequences if applied to sets with uncountably infinite
members. In such set, object can divide into five pieces that can rotate, translate, and invert to make
much greater volume {Banach-Tarski theorem}.
 
  Zorn lemma
  In partially ordered sets in which subsets have upper bounds, sets have greatest member {Zorn's
lemma} {Zorn lemma}. Zorn's lemma is equivalent to axiom of choice.
 MATH>Set Theory>Infinite Set


 
  infinite set
  Sets {infinite set} can have unlimited numbers of elements, with no greatest element.
 
  aleph naught
   The  smallest  infinite  set  {aleph  naught}  is  enumerable.  Enumerable  sets  include  cardinal
numbers, ordinal numbers, integers, and rational numbers {algebraic-equation solutions}, which all
have same size.
 
  power of the continuum
  The next-smallest infinite set is all points on a line {power of the continuum} {aleph one}, which
is equivalent to all n-dimensional space points and to all real numbers. The second-smallest infinite set
is all curves {aleph two}. Even-higher infinite sets exist, up to infinity {aleph infinity} {aleph naught
naught}.
 
  Cantor diagonal process
  Rational-number sets have same infinity level as counting-number sets, as proved by Cantor's
diagonal process {diagonalization} {Cantor diagonal process} {diagonal proof}.
  rational numbers
  Make table with infinite rows and columns. Cells have positive rational numbers. First row is a
positive-integer series. Second row is a positive-integer series, each divided by 2. nth row is a positive-
integer series, each divided by n.
  To count fractions, start at top left 0. Go down one row to 0/2. Go diagonally up and right to first
row at 1. Go right one column to 2. Go diagonally down and left to first column at 0/3. Repeat to cover
all cells and count all fractions. Fractions count only once, establishing one-to-one correspondence
between counting numbers and rational numbers.
  real numbers
  The real-number set has higher infinity than counting-number set. List real numbers in sequence
as table. Rows are real numbers. Columns are digits. Along diagonals through table are real numbers,
with one digit from each row and column. Change all digits of main-diagonal real number. Resulting
real number is not any real number already in table, because all row and column digits have changed.
Therefore, real numbers number more than counting numbers, and no one-to-one correspondence exists
between counting numbers and real numbers.
 
    continuum hypothesis
   No  set  has  size  between  integer-set  size  and  real-number-set  size  {continuum  hypothesis}
{continuum problem}. No aleph is between aleph naught and aleph one. Raising any positive integer to
aleph-naught power results in aleph one.
  indeterminible
  Continuum hypothesis is indeterminable under set theory.
  generalized continuum hypothesis
  Positive integers raised to aleph n power equal aleph n+1 {generalized continuum hypothesis}.
Generalized continuum hypothesis is independent of set theory.
 
  Cantor set
  In continuous intervals, continually removing inner third of remaining continuous interval still
leaves infinitely many points, and total empty distance is interval length {Cantor set}. Cantor sets are
the same at all scales. 1/f noise is like Cantor sets. 
  Cantor paradox
  Power sets are larger than their basis sets {Cantor's paradox} {Cantor paradox}. Therefore, there
can be no largest set and no set of all sets.
 
  Galileo paradox
  Are infinite sets countable {paradox of Galileo} {Galileo paradox}?
 MATH>Set Theory>Laws


 
    absorption law
  Union of set a and its intersection with another set b is the set {absorption law}: a V (a & b) = a.
Intersection of set a and its union with another set b is the set: a & (a V b) = a.
 
    idempotent law
  Union of set a with itself is the set {idempotent law}: a V a = a. Intersection of set a with itself is
the set: a & a = a.
 
  De Morgan laws for sets
  Absolute complement of set union equals intersection of set absolute complements {De Morgan's
laws,  set}  {De  Morgan  laws,  set}  {De  Morgan's  complement}:  ~(a  V  b)  =  ~a  &  ~b.  Absolute
complement of set intersection equals union of set absolute complements: ~(a & b) = ~a V ~b.
 
  involution of set
  Absolute complement of set absolute complement is set {involution, set}: ~(~a) = a. Absolute
complement of empty set is universal set. Absolute complement of universal set is empty set.
 MATH>Set Theory>Laws Of Form


 
  laws of form
  Sets have types {theory of types, laws of form} {laws of form}. Sets have lower or higher type
than other sets. Lower sets cannot be in statements about higher sets, and higher sets cannot be in
statements about lower sets.
  differences
  Laws of form use differences {calculus of indications}.
  self-reference
  In set type, boundary contains object surrounded, and object is boundary {self-reference, set}.
Self-reference allows references to members, classes, classes of classes, and so on. Imaginary numbers
express self-reference and self-referential statements, because imaginary numbers can represent time
dimensions.
  Statements that use set types correctly can use self-reference. Statements that do not use set types
correctly must not use self-reference.
  space or set
  Members, definition, description, selection, name, or statement define space or set {space, laws
of form}. Spaces can imply boundaries and have natural boundaries. Absolute time and relative time
can be boundaries and show boundary history {creativity, laws of form}.
  logical laws
  Laws of form are equivalent to logical laws. NOT a = marked a. a OR b = NOT a AND NOT b. a
AND b = NOT (NOT a OR NOT b). a THEN b = NOT a OR b.
 
    boundary in sets
  Sets have open or closed boundaries {boundary, set}. Actions can create a boundary {expansion,
laws of form} or cross a boundary {contraction, laws of form}. Complex actions combine expansions
and contractions.
  marking
  Boundary side can be positive {marked region} and other side negative {unmarked region}.
  space
  Drawing boundary inside space tells nothing about whole space. Encircling whole space with
boundary tells nothing about whole space.
  boundary making
  Interaction between observer and system {boundary making} makes larger system containing
both observer and original system. Observer can surround all or some sets or be inside a set in the set
hierarchy.
  Observer cannot know whole system, only part close to boundary. Observer makes boundaries to
describe whole system.
  interval
  Regions {interval, laws of form} have boundaries. Boundaries can be in marked sets or spaces
{open interval, set}. Boundaries can not be in marked sets or spaces {closed interval, set}.
  operations at boundaries
  Going from inside boundary to outside boundary is opposite operation {inverse, laws of form}.
Going from inside boundary to outside boundary, and then going from inside boundary to outside
boundary, results in original condition {identity, laws of form}. Drawing same boundary second time is
NULL operation and gives no new information.
 
    contraction statement
  Two mutually exclusive same-type sets can become one same-type set, by crossing a boundary.Statements {contraction statement} can name two classes {categorizing, laws of form} and a relation
{description, laws of form}, such as equality, with a reference point from which to relate members.
Instructions {selection rule, laws of form} can be about how to select members. Processes can cross
boundaries.
 
    expansion statement
  Sets can divide into two mutually exclusive same-type sets, by creating a boundary. Statements
{expansion  statement}  can  name  {naming,  laws  of  form}  classes  {definition,  expansion}  and  a
distinction,  such  as  equality,  with  a  reference  point  from  which  to  identify  members.  Instructions
{selection rule, expansion} can be about how to select members. Processes can draw boundaries.
 MATH>Set Theory>Set Properties


 
    abstraction principle
   If  all  set  members  have  a  property,  set  has  property  {abstraction  principle}  {principle  of
abstraction}.
 
    adjunction
  Elements added to sets {adjunction} can extend set properties.
 
  bound of set
  Sets have a highest member {upper bound, set} {bound}. Sets have a lowest member {lower
bound, set}. Sets can have minimum at highest member {greatest lower bound, set}. Sets can have
maximum at lowest member {least upper bound, set}.
 
  cyclic permutation
  Ordered-set elements can advance one place {cyclic permutation}. Cyclic permutations can have
only two elements {transposition, set}.
 
    extension principle
  Two sets are equal if and only if sets have same members {principle of extension} {extension
principle}.
 
    injection mapping
  The identity relation can apply to domain subset {injection mapping}.
 
  integral domain
  Sets can have two binary operations {integral domain}. Operations make commutative rings and
have identity elements. First operation has identity element if second operation happens.
 
  interior point
  Open sets can contain no point {interior point} at boundary.
 
    one-to-one correspondence
  Two sets are equivalent if their elements pair {one-to-one correspondence}|.
 
  ordered in sets
  Relations {ordered} between two or more things can have sequence. Sequence does not have to
be complete {partial order}.
  number
  For two things, first {first coordinate} and second {second coordinate} make pair {ordered pair,
set} or relation {binary relation}. First coordinate belongs to domain. Second coordinate belongs to
range. Second coordinate derives from first coordinate {Cartesian product, pair}.
  Relations can be among many things {ordered n-tuple} {n-ary relation}, with many coordinates.
  types
  Order can be linear {simple order} {linear order}. All set members can have simple order {chain,
set}. Non-empty sets can have unique lowest members {well-ordered set}.
  value
  Sets can have unique lowest {least element} member. Sets can have unique highest {greatest
element} member. Maximum at lowest member {least upper bound, element} and minimum at highestmember {greatest lower bound, element} bound interval.
 
    partition of set
  Sets can split {partition, set}| into mutually exclusive subsets.
 
    symmetric in sets
  Relation between second coordinate and first coordinate can be image of relation between first
coordinate  and  second  coordinate  {symmetric}.  Relations  can  be  reflexive  and  transitive
{antisymmetric}, so both members are equal.

  He lived 1781 to 1848 and studied continuity and set theory. Real numbers in closed intervals
can be in one-to-one correspondence with real numbers in other closed intervals. Infinite sequences in
closed intervals have limits {Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem}. Truths can be a priori. Logic is about
ideals, not about time or space.

   He  invented  continuum  hypothesis.  Cardinal-number  series  and  ordinal-number  series  are
infinite. Irrational numbers in closed intervals are rational-number-series limits. Sets of limits can have
sets of limits, and so on, to infinity.

number. Therefore, infinite ordinal-number sets cannot exist {Burali-Forti paradox}. Ordinal-number
