# Berkeley's Philosophical Positions by Topic

---

## 1. VISION

**Position 1.1:** Visual ideas and tangible ideas are entirely heterogeneous—they are different in kind, not merely different instances of the same type of quality. What I see and what I touch are numerically and qualitatively distinct ideas that have no necessary connection to one another.

**Position 1.2:** Distance is not immediately perceived by sight. The retinal image is flat, containing no intrinsic information about how far away objects are. What we call "seeing distance" is actually a judgment or inference based on learned associations between visual cues and tactile/kinesthetic experiences.

**Position 1.3:** The visual field is a language that must be learned. Visual ideas serve as signs that suggest tangible ideas, just as words suggest the things they signify. The connection between visual sign and tactile signified is established entirely through experience, not through any inherent resemblance.

**Position 1.4:** The apparent magnitude of objects (how large they look) varies with distance and viewing conditions, while tangible magnitude remains constant. This demonstrates that visible extension and tangible extension are distinct kinds of ideas, not the same property apprehended through different channels.

**Position 1.5:** Confusion in the theory of vision arises from the false assumption that visible and tangible ideas are of the same kind and that we perceive by geometry. We do not calculate distances trigonometrically; we read visual signs that experience has taught us to correlate with tangible realities.

**Position 1.6:** The proper objects of sight are light and colors, with their various degrees and variations. Everything beyond this—three-dimensional spatial properties, real magnitudes, real shapes—belongs to touch and is merely suggested by visual experience.

**Position 1.7:** A purely visual experience, unaccompanied by any tactile associations (as in a person born blind who suddenly gains sight), would present no information whatsoever about three-dimensional space, tangible shape, or distance. The visual field would be an uninterpreted array of colors.

**Position 1.8:** The unity of a perceived object—the fact that we take what we see and what we touch to be "the same thing"—is not given immediately but is a construction based on the constant conjunction of visual and tactile ideas. Custom and experience alone forge this unity.

**Position 1.9:** Faintness, confusion, and the interposition of intermediate objects serve as visual signs of distance, not because they geometrically entail distance, but because experience has connected these visual appearances with the tangible experience of remoteness.

**Position 1.10:** The visual field considered in itself, apart from all tactile associations, would have no depth—it would be, as it were, a two-dimensional manifold of colored points at no distance from the perceiver (since distance itself is a tangible, not visible, idea).

## 2. MOLYNEUX'S PROBLEM

**Position 2.1:** The answer to Molyneux's problem is decisively negative: a person born blind who gains sight would NOT immediately recognize by sight the shapes they previously knew only by touch. They would need to learn the correlations through experience.

**Position 2.2:** The newly sighted person's initial visual experience would be an undifferentiated array of colors with no discernible spatial structure, depth, or recognizable shapes. The visual field would be meaningless until interpreted through learned associations.

**Position 2.3:** There is no necessary connection between the visible appearance of a sphere and its tangible properties. The visual idea of a sphere (a flat disk of color with certain shading patterns) has nothing intrinsically in common with the tactile idea of a sphere (a continuous convex surface).

**Position 2.4:** Those who think the newly sighted person would immediately recognize shapes are confusing the distinct ideas of sight and touch, falsely assuming that both senses access the same spatial properties. This is the fundamental error in the theory of vision.

**Position 2.5:** The heterogeneity of visual and tactile ideas means there is no a priori bridge between them. The connection must be forged entirely through experience—through repeated correlations of visual appearances with tactile explorations.

**Position 2.6:** Molyneux's problem serves as a crucial test case demonstrating that spatial knowledge is not innate. If it were innate, or if there were a common spatial property accessed by both senses, the newly sighted person would recognize shapes immediately.

**Position 2.7:** The newly sighted person must learn which visual appearances correspond to which tangible realities, just as a child must learn which words correspond to which things. Vision is a language whose vocabulary must be acquired through experience.

**Position 2.8:** The fact that the Cheselden case (and similar cases) confirmed the negative answer to Molyneux's problem provides empirical vindication of the theory that visible and tangible ideas are heterogeneous.

**Position 2.9:** There can be no universal language of spatial experience that transcends sense modalities, because each sense modality produces its own distinct type of idea. The "same space" apparently perceived by sight and touch is a construction, not a given.

**Position 2.10:** The unity of the visual and tactile worlds in mature perception is an achievement of experience, not a starting point. The apparent seamlessness of our spatial perception conceals a complex learned coordination of heterogeneous sensory inputs.

## 3. HOW THE SENSES INTERACT TO GIVE US KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD

**Position 3.1:** The belief that visual and tactile ideas are properties of the "same object" arises entirely from the constant conjunction of these ideas in experience. There is no pre-established harmony or necessary connection; only regular correlation teaches us to unite them.

**Position 3.2:** There is no "master sense" or common sensorium that unifies the deliverances of the different senses. Unification is achieved through association, memory, and habit—the mind connects ideas that regularly occur together.

**Position 3.3:** Visual ideas serve as signs suggesting tangible ideas, much as words suggest their meanings. The connection is arbitrary (not based on resemblance) but becomes so ingrained through experience that it seems immediate and natural.

**Position 3.4:** When I see fire and feel heat, I associate these ideas because they constantly conjoin in experience. The "source" is not some hidden material substance but the ideas themselves, whose regular connection is maintained by the Author of Nature.

**Position 3.5:** The regularity and predictability of sense-correlations tells us something important: that the ideas we perceive are not random or arbitrary but are governed by stable laws instituted by God. This regularity is the "grammar" of nature's language.

**Position 3.6:** One sense does not strictly "correct" another, since each sense provides its own distinct ideas. Rather, what happens is that we learn to give primacy to certain senses (especially touch) for certain purposes and treat other senses as providing signs for those realities.

**Position 3.7:** The "external world" as ordinarily conceived—the stable, three-dimensional world of tangible objects—is a construction from coordinated sensory patterns. What we call physical objects are collections of ideas whose coherence and stability is maintained by divine providence.

**Position 3.8:** Memory plays an essential role in the synthesis of sense information. Without the ability to recall past correlations, we could not learn the visual language or anticipate tangible consequences from visual signs.

**Position 3.9:** The coordination of the senses is providentially arranged for our practical benefit. Visual ideas serve to warn us of tangible consequences (pain, pleasure, nourishment, danger) before we undergo them—this is the function of the visual language.

**Position 3.10:** The reliability of sense-correlations does not depend on any underlying material substrate but on the constancy of divine volition in producing ideas according to stable rules. God's faithfulness, not matter's existence, grounds the reliability of perception.

## 4. EMPIRICISM

**Position 4.1:** All legitimate ideas ultimately derive from sensory experience. There can be no idea that does not trace back to some sensation or reflection on our own mental operations. Ideas are either direct copies of experience or compositions of experiential elements.

**Position 4.2:** The origin of ideas like "substance" and "cause" is problematic. If we attend carefully to experience, we find no impression of substance (the supposed underlying substratum) and no impression of necessary connection. These are often words without clear ideational content.

**Position 4.3:** There are no genuinely abstract general ideas. We do not and cannot conceive of "triangle in general" (neither equilateral, nor isosceles, nor scalene, but somehow all and none of these). General thinking uses particular ideas as representative signs for whole classes.

**Position 4.4:** Reason alone, without experience, can give us no knowledge of matters of fact. Mathematical and logical truths concern the relations of ideas, but any knowledge of what actually exists must come through perception.

**Position 4.5:** Philosophical error frequently arises from using words without attending to the ideas they should signify. Empty verbiage—talk of "matter," "substance," "abstract ideas"—proliferates when philosophers fail to cash out their terms in experiential currency.

**Position 4.6:** Claims about things that cannot in principle be experienced are meaningless or confused. If no possible experience could verify or even illustrate a claim, we should suspect that the words composing it lack genuine ideational content.

**Position 4.7:** The test for whether a concept is meaningful is whether we can trace it back to experiential sources. Can I form a clear and distinct idea corresponding to this word? If not, the word may be empty—a mere noise that creates the illusion of thought.

**Position 4.8:** Mathematical knowledge, including geometry, is grounded in experience insofar as it concerns perceivable magnitudes. Mathematical abstractions that outrun all possible perception (like infinitesimals) are suspect.

**Position 4.9:** The error of supposing every word names something real is responsible for much philosophical mischief. "Matter," "substance," "being in general"—these words trick us into positing entities for which we have no experiential warrant.

**Position 4.10:** Careful attention to the actual contents of experience—what we genuinely perceive, imagine, and conceive—is the cure for philosophical confusion. Most metaphysical problems dissolve when we abandon empty abstractions and return to concrete experience.

## 5. WHETHER (AND IF SO WHY) EMPIRICISM WARRANTS IDEALISM

**Position 5.1:** If all knowledge comes from experience, and experience consists entirely of ideas (perceptions in the mind), then we have no grounds for positing anything beyond ideas. The concept of "matter" as a mind-independent substance has no experiential foundation.

**Position 5.2:** "Matter" defined as something that exists independently of all perception is not merely unknown but inconceivable. We cannot form any positive idea of it. The very attempt to conceive of unexperienced existence involves imagining ourselves perceiving it, which is self-defeating.

**Position 5.3:** The concept of a mind-independent material substrate is incoherent. To be is to be perceived or to perceive (esse is percipi aut percipere). Existence unperceived by any mind is a contradiction in terms when we attend to what "existence" actually means.

**Position 5.4:** I can only ever know ideas. To verify that something non-ideal corresponds to my ideas, I would need to compare my ideas with that non-ideal something—but any comparison would yield only more ideas. We are locked within the circle of experience.

**Position 5.5:** The hypothesis of matter does no explanatory work. It cannot explain how ideas arise (material causation of mental effects being unintelligible), cannot be perceived, and serves only as an unnecessary metaphysical placeholder.

**Position 5.6:** The regularity and coherence of experience does not require a material cause. It can be explained—indeed, better explained—by reference to the will of God, who produces ideas in our minds according to stable laws.

**Position 5.7:** Matter is an inference from experience, but the inference is unwarranted. From the fact that we have ideas, nothing follows about the existence of unexperienceable material causes. The inference adds nothing to our knowledge and introduces insoluble problems.

**Position 5.8:** The impossibility of comparing ideas with non-ideas means that any inference to something beyond ideas is untestable, unverifiable, and without empirical warrant. Empiricism rigorously pursued cannot support materialist metaphysics.

**Position 5.9:** No evidence could in principle support the existence of something fundamentally unlike any possible experience. The demand for such evidence is misguided, and the hypothesis that there is such a thing is not a hypothesis at all—it is empty verbiage.

**Position 5.10:** The strict empiricist should accept idealism, since idealism simply draws out the consequences of taking experience seriously as the sole source of knowledge. If this is surprising, the surprise reflects unexamined materialist prejudice, not a problem with the argument.

---

## 6. PHENOMENALISM

**Position 6.1:** The existence of physical objects can and should be analyzed in terms of actual and possible experiences. To say "the table exists" just is to say that certain stable, coherent patterns of ideas are and would be perceived under appropriate conditions.

**Position 6.2:** To say that a tree exists when no finite mind is perceiving it means that God perceives it, or that we would perceive it if appropriately situated. The tree's continued existence is grounded in divine perception and in the truth of counterfactual claims about what we would experience.

**Position 6.3:** Objects have continuity and independence in the sense that the patterns of experience they constitute are stable, lawful, and not dependent on any particular finite perceiver's whims. They are independent of my will but not of mind as such.

**Position 6.4:** There is no meaningful difference between "the table exists" and "certain table-experiences would occur under appropriate conditions" except that the latter makes explicit what the former means implicitly. Phenomenalism clarifies rather than changes the subject.

**Position 6.5:** Veridical experiences are distinguished from illusions by their coherence, stability, regularity, and integration with other experiences. The "reality" of an experience is determined by its place in the total lawful pattern of experience, not by correspondence to hidden matter.

**Position 6.6:** Counterfactual statements about what we would experience are grounded in the laws of nature instituted by God. These laws determine which combinations of ideas are possible and what would follow from various conditions.

**Position 6.7:** Phenomenalism accounts for the lawfulness of nature by reference to the consistency of divine volition. God produces ideas according to stable rules, which we discover through experience and call "laws of nature."

**Position 6.8:** God's continuous perception provides the ontological ground for the continuity of the world. Without an infinite mind to perceive the tree when no finite mind does, the tree's continued existence would be unintelligible.

**Position 6.9:** Phenomenalism does not eliminate the physical world but reinterprets what physical existence means. Tables, chairs, and mountains remain as real as ever—they are just ideas in minds rather than mind-independent material substances.

**Position 6.10:** Phenomenalism clarifies what our ordinary talk of matter legitimately amounts to: discourse about stable patterns of actual and possible experience. It removes the unintelligible metaphysical substrate and keeps everything that matters for practical and scientific purposes.

## 7. DATA MODELLING

**Position 7.1:** When we construct models to predict observations, we are organizing appearances—discerning the grammar of nature's language. Whether this counts as "discovering truths about reality" depends on what we mean by reality. If reality is the system of ideas, then yes; if reality means hidden matter, the question is confused.

**Position 7.2:** The relationship between a predictive model and "underlying nature" is not one of correspondence to hidden mechanisms but of faithfully representing the laws governing phenomena. The model captures real regularities in experience.

**Position 7.3:** Different models may fit the same data equally well. Since the data (experience) is what matters, the question of which model is "really true" of hidden reality is often meaningless. We should choose models by criteria of simplicity, scope, and fruitfulness.

**Position 7.4:** A model is good if it enables us to predict and organize experience, if it is simple, coherent, and comprehensive. These are the legitimate criteria—not correspondence to an unknowable material substrate.

**Position 7.5:** Simplicity in models is more than practical convenience. The laws of nature instituted by God are general and simple; simplicity in our models may reflect the genuine simplicity of divine action.

**Position 7.6:** Models should not posit unobservable entities as if they referred to something beyond all possible experience. If theoretical terms are useful, their utility lies in organizing experience, not in naming hidden substances.

**Position 7.7:** Mathematical models can capture real regularities in the phenomena. What they cannot do is penetrate behind the phenomena to a material substrate. The model relates ideas to ideas, not ideas to matter.

**Position 7.8:** Theoretical terms in models should be interpreted instrumentally—as useful calculating devices—unless they can be cashed out in experiential terms. "Force," "attraction," and similar terms do not name hidden causes but summarize observable patterns.

**Position 7.9:** The goal of science is to organize experience and formulate general laws that enable prediction. This is entirely achievable without positing mind-independent matter. Whether we call this "truth" is a verbal question.

**Position 7.10:** When two incompatible models both save the phenomena, we should not ask which describes hidden reality (a meaningless question) but which is more elegant, more comprehensive, or more fruitful for future inquiry.

---

## 8. THE PHENOMENAL REDUCTION

**Position 8.1:** Translating claims about physical objects into claims about experiences clarifies meaning and dissolves pseudoproblems. We gain precision and avoid the confusions that arise from talk of unexperienceable substances.

**Position 8.2:** Every meaningful statement about the physical world can be reformulated in phenomenal terms—in terms of actual and possible experiences. Claims that resist such translation are suspect as empty or confused.

**Position 8.3:** Eliminating reference to unexperienceable entities loses nothing of cognitive value. We retain all the empirical content of our claims while discarding the metaphysical baggage. Strict empiricism demands this reduction.

**Position 8.4:** The phenomenal reduction is a clarification of meaning. When we say "there is a table," we mean something about experiences; the reduction makes explicit what ordinary language leaves implicit.

**Position 8.5:** Reducing talk of matter to talk of ideas resolves disputes like those about skepticism. Once we see that objects just are patterns of ideas, the "gap" between experience and reality vanishes, and skeptical worries are shown to rest on confusion.

**Position 8.6:** Statements about the past and future can be translated into statements about present and possible experiences: what evidence is available now, what memories and records yield, what future experiences we anticipate. The past is what explains and the future is what we predict.

**Position 8.7:** The phenomenal reduction is motivated by empiricist scruples: a commitment to ground all meaningful claims in possible experience, and a recognition that claims transcending possible experience are empty.

**Position 8.8:** The reduction captures the full cognitive meaning of object-talk. If something is left over that resists reduction—some supposed "thinghood" beyond all experience—that residue is not a genuine meaning but a confusion.

**Position 8.9:** Statements about other minds present a challenge, but they too can be analyzed phenomenally: other minds are posited on the basis of observed behaviors (experienced ideas) and by analogy with my own case. The evidence is always experiential.

**Position 8.10:** The phenomenal reduction is simultaneously epistemological (about what we can know), semantic (about what claims mean), and metaphysical (about what exists). These aspects are interconnected: what can be known grounds what can be meant and what can exist.

## 9. WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATA MODELLING AND TRUTH DISCOVERY

**Position 9.1:** When a model successfully predicts observations, we have discovered truths about the regularities governing experience. Whether this counts as truth about "reality" depends on how we define reality. If reality is experience and its laws, then yes.

**Position 9.2:** "Fitting the data" and "getting things right" are the same when properly understood. The data (experience) is what there is to get right about. There is no further hidden reality that our models might miss while fitting the data.

**Position 9.3:** Theories cannot be "empirically adequate yet false about nature" if we understand that the nature of things just is the pattern of ideas governed by law. There is no gap between empirical adequacy and truth about phenomena.

**Position 9.4:** Model-building counts as genuine discovery when it reveals real laws governing the succession and combination of ideas. These laws are genuinely there to be found—they are instituted by God and are not inventions of the human mind.

**Position 9.5:** Theoretical entities like "forces" and "fields" are best understood as constructed calculating devices rather than discovered substances. What we discover is the mathematical relations among phenomena; the theoretical terms are tools for expressing these relations.

**Position 9.6:** Science aims at truth about experience and its laws. This is a modest but entirely legitimate aim. The pretension to know hidden material causes is not scientific but metaphysical, and is unwarranted by the actual methods of science.

**Position 9.7:** If different models equally account for all possible observations, there may be no fact about which is "true of hidden reality" because there is no hidden reality. There may, however, be facts about which is simpler, more elegant, or more useful.

**Position 9.8:** Explanatory power is valuable insofar as it enables prediction and unifies diverse phenomena under general laws. The idea that explanation requires invoking hidden mechanisms is a materialist prejudice without empirical support.

**Position 9.9:** We should be cautious about believing in theoretical entities posited by our models. Their utility for prediction does not establish their mind-independent existence. Useful fictions are fictions nonetheless.

**Position 9.10:** Pragmatic success is evidence that we have grasped the real laws governing phenomena. It is not evidence for correspondence to unknowable material reality, because such correspondence is neither testable nor meaningful.

---

## 10. THE CALCULUS

**Position 10.1:** The foundations of the calculus, as formulated by Newton and Leibniz, are not secure. They rely on notions (infinitesimals, fluxions, nascent and evanescent quantities) that are obscure, contradictory, and incapable of being distinctly conceived.

**Position 10.2:** Quantities that are "neither zero nor any assignable finite amount" are unintelligible. We can form no clear idea of such things. The mind cannot conceive of a quantity that is somehow less than any finite amount yet greater than nothing.

**Position 10.3:** Practical success does not vindicate obscure foundations. That the calculus yields correct results is remarkable but does not prove that its principles are sound. We need foundations we can clearly understand, not just methods that happen to work.

**Position 10.4:** To speak of the ratio of quantities "at the moment they vanish" is incoherent. A quantity that has vanished is zero, and the ratio of zeros is indeterminate. Newton's talk of "ultimate ratios" papers over this fundamental problem.

**Position 10.5:** The results of calculus may be true discoveries about magnitude if the calculus can be reformulated on solid foundations. But as currently presented, we have no right to be confident in results derived from unintelligible principles.

**Position 10.6:** Limits and infinitesimals need rigorous reformulation. The reliance on intuition and physical metaphor (flowing quantities, instantaneous velocities) is no substitute for clear mathematical reasoning.

**Position 10.7:** It is not legitimate to operate with quantities we cannot coherently conceive. Mathematics should be held to the same standards of conceptual clarity as other disciplines. Mystification is not profundity.

**Position 10.8:** Treating symbolic manipulations as if they revealed deep truths is an error. The symbols must have clear meanings attached to them, or we are merely playing with marks on paper without genuine mathematical content.

**Position 10.9:** Mathematicians should be held to the same standards of clarity as other reasoners. The prestige of mathematics does not exempt it from the demand that its concepts be distinctly conceived and its inferences be valid.

**Position 10.10:** The calculus should be reformulated to avoid reliance on infinitesimals and other obscure notions. Perhaps it can be grounded in finite quantities and limiting processes properly understood—but this work has not yet been done satisfactorily.

---

## 11. INFINITESIMALS

**Position 11.1:** There cannot be a quantity smaller than any finite quantity yet greater than zero. This is a contradiction. The mind cannot conceive of a positive quantity that is yet less than every positive quantity, however small.

**Position 11.2:** When we use the term "infinitesimal," we do not actually conceive anything. The word gestures at an impossible object. Our mathematical practice may use the term, but no clear idea corresponds to it.

**Position 11.3:** The infinitesimal is not a genuine mathematical object but at best a convenient fiction, and at worst a source of conceptual confusion. Its utility does not establish its coherence.

**Position 11.4:** We cannot justify operations on quantities whose very existence is unintelligible. If x is an infinitesimal, and we cannot say what x is, how can we legitimately add, multiply, or integrate it?

**Position 11.5:** Infinitesimals do not represent anything real about continuous magnitude. Continuous quantities are finitely extended; the idea that they are composed of infinitely many infinitesimal parts is confused.

**Position 11.6:** Treating infinitesimals as actual existing quantities leads to contradictions: they must be both zero (because less than any finite quantity) and nonzero (because they contribute to sums and have ratios). This is incoherent.

**Position 11.7:** Rigorous mathematics without infinitesimals should be possible. The correct results obtained by infinitesimal methods should be recoverable on a solid foundation—but this requires reconceiving the calculus from the ground up.

**Position 11.8:** The notation "dx" and "dy" does not name any actual quantities. These are symbolic devices whose manipulation yields results, but the symbols do not refer to infinitely small things (for there are no such things).

**Position 11.9:** The success of infinitesimal methods may result from compensating errors. False steps in opposite directions may cancel out, leaving a correct answer arrived at by invalid reasoning. This should not satisfy us.

**Position 11.10:** A truly clear and rigorous foundation for analysis would require us to define all terms distinctly, to avoid positing impossible quantities, and to ensure that every step of reasoning is demonstrably valid. We are far from this ideal.

## 12. PERSONAL GROWTH AND HEALTH

**Position 12.1:** Bodily health and the health of the mind or spirit are deeply interconnected. A sound body supports clear thinking and virtuous action; conversely, disorders of thought and passion manifest in bodily ailments.

**Position 12.2:** To flourish as a whole person requires attention to both body and soul—proper diet, exercise, and regimen for the body; proper education, virtue, and piety for the soul. Neither can be neglected without harm to the other.

**Position 12.3:** Attention to bodily health is not merely a concession to animal nature but a duty. The body is the instrument through which we act in the world; maintaining it in good order serves intellectual and moral purposes.

**Position 12.4:** Philosophy should contribute to practical well-being, not merely theoretical speculation. A philosophy that leaves us no better able to live well is deficient. Wisdom includes knowing how to be happy.

**Position 12.5:** Habits of temperance, moderation, and regular living conduce to flourishing. Excess and disorder—in diet, sleep, passions, or study—undermine both health and virtue. The ancient connection between ethics and regimen was sound.

**Position 12.6:** There is a unity to human well-being. Physical and spiritual goods are not separate streams but interconnected aspects of a single flourishing life. What harms the body harms the soul, and vice versa.

**Position 12.7:** We should balance the pursuit of knowledge with care for practical life. Excessive speculation divorced from lived reality is both intellectually sterile and personally harmful. Philosophy should make us better, not merely more clever.

**Position 12.8:** Divine providence is ultimately the source of human health and happiness. Our efforts cooperate with providence when we live according to nature and virtue; we thwart providence when we indulge vice and excess.

**Position 12.9:** Wisdom in living requires acknowledging uncertainty and limitation. We cannot control all things; we can only order our own minds and habits. True wisdom combines intellectual humility with practical prudence.

**Position 12.10:** Clear thinking itself contributes to personal flourishing. Philosophical confusion is not merely an intellectual defect but a source of unnecessary suffering. Getting our concepts right helps us live well.

## 13. TAR WATER

**Position 13.1:** Tar water possesses genuine medicinal properties discovered through careful observation and experience. It is effective against a wide range of ailments, from fevers to digestive complaints, and is particularly valuable for its gentleness and safety.

**Position 13.2:** Tar water works by infusing the system with a subtle, active principle—a kind of aether or vital fire—that promotes health by enlivening the body's processes without the violence of stronger medicines.

**Position 13.3:** Simple natural remedies often exceed complex medical interventions in safety and efficacy. The search for elaborate compounds may miss the healing properties readily available in humble substances like tar.

**Position 13.4:** Close observation and accumulated experience can ground medical knowledge as reliably as, or more reliably than, theoretical medicine. Direct attention to effects in particular cases often reveals what theory obscures.

**Position 13.5:** Folk remedies and traditional cures deserve respectful examination. The collective experience of ordinary people over many generations may encode genuine knowledge that academic medicine has overlooked.

**Position 13.6:** The vital principle or aether that pervades nature may be the active agent in many remedies. This connects medicine to broader philosophical questions about the nature of life and activity in the world.

**Position 13.7:** There is a connection between the simplicity of a remedy and its safety. Violent, complex medicines often do more harm than good; gentle remedies that work with nature are preferable.

**Position 13.8:** Medicine should address not only bodily ailments but also disorders of mind and spirit. Tar water's calming, clarifying effects on the mind are as valuable as its physical benefits.

**Position 13.9:** Reflection on health and medicine yields philosophical insights. The study of life, healing, and the body illuminates broader questions about nature, causation, and the relation of mind to matter.

**Position 13.10:** Testimony and experience must be carefully weighed in evaluating medical claims. Personal observation, the reports of trustworthy witnesses, and attention to what actually helps (rather than what theory predicts) should guide medical judgment.

---

## 14. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAITH AND PHILOSOPHY

**Position 14.1:** Philosophical reasoning can support religious faith by removing obstacles and demonstrating the rational credentials of belief. Philosophy and faith are allies, not enemies; reason properly exercised leads toward, not away from, God.

**Position 14.2:** The existence of God follows from philosophical principles—specifically, from the idealist recognition that ideas require a mind to perceive them. The regularities of nature point to a divine perceiver who maintains the world in existence.

**Position 14.3:** Idealism strongly supports theism. If to be is to be perceived, the continued existence of the world when no finite mind perceives it requires an infinite mind. God is not an optional addition to idealist metaphysics but integral to it.

**Position 14.4:** Philosophy's proper role is to clarify, support, and defend revealed religion, not to replace it. Reason can show that faith is not irrational; it cannot substitute for faith or exhaust the content of revelation.

**Position 14.5:** Philosophical argument can remove obstacles to faith—for instance, by refuting materialism and atheism—without directly proving every article of belief. It prepares the way for faith by showing that belief is reasonable.

**Position 14.6:** Skepticism about the material world is not only compatible with but conducive to faith in spiritual realities. Once we see that matter is a philosophical chimera, we are freed from materialism and opened to the primacy of spirit.

**Position 14.7:** When philosophy and religious teaching appear to conflict, we should examine whether the philosophical position in question is well-founded. Genuine philosophical truth will not conflict with genuine religious truth; apparent conflicts indicate error somewhere.

**Position 14.8:** Philosophy has limits beyond which faith must take over. Reason can demonstrate that God exists and is good; revelation tells us more specifically who God is and what God wills. Philosophy points toward mysteries it cannot fully penetrate.

**Position 14.9:** The God of the philosophers—the necessary being, the sustainer of ideas—is identical with the God of Abraham, though known under different descriptions. Natural theology and revealed theology concern the same God.

**Position 14.10:** The same mind can and should hold both rigorous philosophical views and sincere religious devotion. There is no incompatibility between intellectual rigor and piety; indeed, each supports the other. The deepest philosophy leads to worship.

## 15. THE EXISTENCE OF UNOBSERVABLES

**Position 15.1:** We have no grounds for believing in entities that are in principle unobservable. The concept of such an entity is empty—we cannot form any positive idea of a thing that by definition cannot be perceived.

**Position 15.2:** The concept of an unobservable entity, defined as something that cannot in principle be perceived by any mind, is incoherent. "Existence" means being perceived or being capable of perception. An absolutely unobservable existent is a contradiction.

**Position 15.3:** Scientific theories that posit unobservable entities should be interpreted instrumentally. The theoretical terms are useful devices for organizing experience and enabling prediction; they do not refer to hidden substances beyond perception.

**Position 15.4:** Explanatory success does not justify belief in unobservable posits. That a theory with unobservable terms predicts well shows that the mathematical structure captures real regularities; it does not show that the unobservable terms name real things.

**Position 15.5:** There is a meaningful difference between things we happen not to observe and things that cannot in principle be observed. The former may be perfectly real (ideas in God's mind, or ideas we could have under different conditions); the latter are unintelligible.

**Position 15.6:** To say that something exists if it can never be perceived by any mind is to say nothing intelligible. We may think we are asserting something, but we are merely mouthing words. Existence unperceived is not existence at all.

**Position 15.7:** We should be instrumentalists rather than realists about theoretical entities in science. Atoms, forces, fields—these are useful calculating devices, not names for hidden things. Science does not require belief in unobservables.

**Position 15.8:** We can have no genuine knowledge of unobservables, only useful models involving them. Knowledge requires ideational content; unobservables, by definition, provide no ideational content. We can know our own constructs but not hidden realities.

**Position 15.9:** The cash value of assertions about unobservables is their predictive and organizational function. When we translate claims about unobservables into claims about what we will observe under what conditions, we capture their entire cognitive content.

**Position 15.10:** Parsimony favors eliminating unobservables from our ontology. If everything we need to explain can be explained without positing unexperienceable substances, we should not posit them. Matter, atoms, and similar entities fail the parsimony test.

---

## 16. COUNTERFACTUAL AND THEORETICAL TRUTH

**Position 16.1:** Counterfactual statements are true in virtue of the laws governing experience, instituted by God. What would have been perceived under certain conditions is determined by the stable regularities that govern the succession and combination of ideas.

**Position 16.2:** What would have been perceived if someone had been there is grounded in two things: God's actual perception (which is always there) and the laws according to which ideas are produced in finite minds under specified conditions.

**Position 16.3:** Theoretical truths about unobserved entities can be genuinely true if interpreted phenomenally. "There are mountains on the far side of the moon" is true if appropriately situated observers would have mountain-ideas—and God's perception ensures the reality.

**Position 16.4:** The truthmaker for counterfactuals is the stable lawful structure of experience maintained by divine will. God's volitions follow consistent rules; these rules determine what would occur under counterfactual conditions.

**Position 16.5:** There are facts about unactualized possibilities insofar as the laws of nature determine what would happen under conditions that do not obtain. The possibilities are not free-floating but grounded in the actual order of nature.

**Position 16.6:** Laws of nature ground counterfactual claims by specifying the general rules according to which ideas succeed one another. If the law says "fire causes heat," then if fire were present, heat would be felt.

**Position 16.7:** A phenomenalist account of counterfactual truth is possible: counterfactuals are true just when the laws connecting types of ideas (visual fire-ideas with tactile heat-ideas, etc.) hold, and the antecedent conditions would activate those laws.

**Position 16.8:** God's knowledge includes knowledge of all possible experiences under all possible conditions. This divine knowledge grounds the truth of counterfactuals about what finite minds would perceive. God's perception is the ultimate truthmaker.

**Position 16.9:** Theoretical statements in science are best understood as instruments for organizing and predicting experience, not as literally true descriptions of hidden realities. Their truth-value is their cash value in experiential consequences.

**Position 16.10:** The truth conditions for statements transcending actual experience must be given in terms of actual and possible experience plus the laws governing experience. Claims that cannot be so analyzed are not genuinely meaningful.

## 17. KNOWLEDGE OF UNIVERSALS

**Position 17.1:** Universal properties like "redness" or "triangularity" do not exist independently of particular instances. There are red things and triangular things; there is not, in addition, an abstract entity "Redness" or "Triangularity" subsisting somewhere.

**Position 17.2:** We do not form genuinely abstract general ideas. All our ideas are particular: this specific shade of red, that particular triangular shape. What we call "general ideas" are particular ideas used in a representative capacity.

**Position 17.3:** Abstraction, conceived as separating out a quality common to many particulars and considering it in isolation, is impossible. We cannot conceive of color without some determinate hue, or extension without some determinate shape and size.

**Position 17.4:** A particular idea can represent all ideas of its kind by functioning as a sign for them. When I use a particular triangle in geometric reasoning, it stands for all triangles—not by being abstractly triangular but by being attended to only in its triangular features.

**Position 17.5:** General words signify many particular ideas indifferently, not one abstract idea. The word "triangle" denotes this isosceles, that scalene, that equilateral—any triangle. Its generality lies in its indifferent application, not in naming an abstract entity.

**Position 17.6:** We do not need abstract general ideas to reason and communicate. Particular ideas serving as representative signs suffice for all the purposes abstract ideas were supposed to serve, without the incoherence abstraction involves.

**Position 17.7:** The mind is incapable of conceiving truly abstract entities. Try to imagine "triangle in general"—you will find yourself imagining some particular triangle. The image is always determinate; the supposed abstraction is a fiction.

**Position 17.8:** Treating general ideas as if they were abstract objects leads to philosophical errors—the postulation of a realm of universals, confusion about the objects of mathematical reasoning, and obscurity about the nature of signification.

**Position 17.9:** Selective attention allows particular ideas to function generally. When I attend to the triangularity of my particular triangular idea and ignore its other features, I can use it to reason about triangles in general—without positing abstracta.

**Position 17.10:** The rejection of abstract ideas has consequences for mathematics. Mathematical entities are not abstract objects but particular ideas (of particular magnitudes, shapes, etc.) considered in their representative capacity.

## 18. COMMON PHILOSOPHICAL ERRORS

**Position 18.1:** The main sources of philosophical confusion are: (a) the misuse of language, (b) the doctrine of abstract ideas, (c) the positing of unexperienceable entities, and (d) inattention to the actual contents of our ideas.

**Position 18.2:** Language misleads when we assume that every meaningful word names a distinct thing. "Matter," "substance," "being"—these words create the illusion that there are entities corresponding to them, when often there are not.

**Position 18.3:** The assumption that every noun names a real entity generates pseudoproblems. When we say "there is motion," we may be tricked into asking "what is motion itself, apart from moving things?" This question rests on a grammatical confusion.

**Position 18.4:** The doctrine of abstract ideas is enormously pernicious. It leads philosophers to posit impossible objects (triangle-in-general, extension-without-shape) and to mistake words for thoughts and verbal distinctions for real distinctions.

**Position 18.5:** Inattention to the actual contents of our ideas lets empty verbiage pass for profound thought. If philosophers would examine what ideas (if any) they have when they use terms like "material substance," much confusion would dissolve.

**Position 18.6:** Confusing signs with things signified is a common error. Words are signs of ideas, and ideas are signs of other ideas; we err when we focus on the signs themselves instead of what they signify, or treat the sign as if it were the reality.

**Position 18.7:** We can distinguish genuine problems from verbal disputes by attending to ideas. If a dispute concerns only words, and both parties have the same ideas under different names, the dispute is merely verbal. Many philosophical controversies are of this kind.

**Position 18.8:** Philosophers posit unobservable entities from a mistaken belief that explanation requires invoking hidden causes. But explanation in terms of unexperienceables is pseudoexplanation; we explain obscurity with greater obscurity.

**Position 18.9:** Habits of mind that help avoid error include: always asking what idea corresponds to a word; checking that supposed ideas are genuinely conceivable; tracing ideas back to their experiential sources; preferring concrete particulars to dubious abstractions.

**Position 18.10:** Returning to ordinary experience and common sense resolves philosophical disputes. The plain person knows that the table exists and has no trouble with skeptical worries; philosophical difficulties arise when we depart from experience into empty abstraction.

## 19. PRAGMATISM (THE PRAGMATIC/INSTRUMENTALIST CONCEPTION OF TRUTH/KNOWLEDGE-ACQUISITION)

**Position 19.1:** The practical success of a belief is significant evidence that it captures real regularities in experience. Beliefs that enable successful action are thereby shown to be attuned to the actual patterns of ideas we encounter.

**Position 19.2:** Theoretical claims should be evaluated partly by their practical consequences. A theory with no experiential consequences is empty; a theory whose consequences are borne out in practice has proven its worth.

**Position 19.3:** Usefulness and truth are connected but not identical. A useful belief tracks real regularities; its usefulness is evidence of truth, not a substitute for truth. But since truth about phenomena just is the accurate representation of experiential regularities, use and truth converge.

**Position 19.4:** The aim of inquiry is to understand the lawful structure of experience. This understanding yields both truth (accurate representation of regularities) and practical success (ability to anticipate and manipulate experience). These aims coincide.

**Position 19.5:** Scientific theories are instruments for prediction and organization of experience. This is not a deflationary claim—organizing experience is a genuine cognitive achievement. But we should not think theories penetrate behind experience to hidden mechanisms.

**Position 19.6:** Theoretical terms that help us predict should be understood instrumentally unless they can be cashed out experientially. The question "do electrons really exist as hidden entities?" is confused; the question "does electron-talk enable successful prediction?" is legitimate.

**Position 19.7:** It matters whether our theories are true in the sense of accurately capturing experiential regularities. Whether they are true in the sense of corresponding to hidden matter is a question without clear meaning.

**Position 19.8:** Believing something because it's true and believing it because it's useful come apart only if we falsely assume that truth transcends all possible experience. For a proper empiricist, truth about phenomena and utility for practice are intimately connected.

**Position 19.9:** Pragmatic criteria alone cannot determine what we should believe, because we must also attend to the intrinsic coherence and content of our ideas. But pragmatic success is strong evidence that our beliefs track genuine features of experience.

**Position 19.10:** Truth, meaning, and practical efficacy are interconnected. Meaning is rooted in experience; truth is the accurate representation of experiential regularities; efficacy results from such accurate representation. These three come together in a properly empiricist framework.
