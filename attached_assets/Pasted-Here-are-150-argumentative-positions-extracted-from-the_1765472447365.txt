**3.** A sincere moral judgment must embody some feeling about its subject.
> “if you say ‘Larry is a bad man,’ your statement, if sincere, must embody feelings of some kind concerning Larry’s deeds or character.”

**13.** People can coolly make moral judgments.
> “It’s clear that people can coolly make moral judgments.”

**14.** Emotion-driven judgment is not an unbiased ethical judgment.
> “an emotion-driven judgment is, to that extent, not an ethical judgment—or, in any case, not an unbiased one.”

**15.** One can make positive moral judgments about displeasing things.
> “One often makes positive moral judgments about people and things that bring them displeasure.”

**16.** One can judge an act as good while personally disliking it.
> “There are people who I dislike whose noble acts make me want to wretch. But… I do judge that those acts are good.”

**17.** Saying “so and so did the right thing” is not saying “hurray.”

> “David Hume… provided a compelling answer to this question…”

**19.** Artistic goodness is often linked to giving pleasure.
> “In general, people regard artistic works that bring them pleasure as ‘good’…”

**20.** “x is good” in art might seem to mean “x gives me pleasure.”
> “…when said of a work of art, ‘x is good’ means ‘x gives me pleasure’…”

**21.** The pleasure analysis of artistic goodness cannot be right.
> “But this analysis cannot quite be right.”

**22.** One can judge a pleasure-less work as good.
> “People can, without self-contradiction, judge that works that don’t bring them pleasure are ‘good’…”

**23.** Irrelevant personal factors can inhibit pleasure from a good work.
> “This happens when people know that they would like a given work were it not for the inhibiting influence of some plainly irrelevant factor.”

**24.** One can know a work is good even if it brings personal torture.
> “So you know that it’s good, even though… it doesn’t bring you pleasure.”

**25.** “Good” in art means it brings pleasure setting aside irrelevancies.
> “when people describe a work of art as ‘good,’ they mean that, setting aside irrelevancies… it brings people pleasure.”

**26.** The same principle applies mutatis mutandis in the moral sphere.
> “The same thing mutatis mutandis holds in the moral sphere.”

**27.** People generally regard happiness-bringing acts as moral.

> “they sometimes regard things that bring them acute pleasure as ‘immoral.’”

**30.** A criminal may commend his own punishment.
> “Many a person has committed heinous crimes and then commended the government for putting him in jail.”

**31.** “x is good” means “x makes people happy barring idiosyncratic factors.”

**32.** Hume’s argument shows emotivism must be changed to be credible.
> “Hume’s powerful argument shows that, if it is to be credible, emotivism must be changed…”

**33.** One can judge something good even if it brings misery.
> “a person can judge that something is good even if that thing brings him misery…”

**34.** Therefore, “x is good” cannot be expressing happiness about x.
> “…saying ‘x is good’ cannot possibly be the same thing as expressing one’s happiness about x.”

**35.** “x is good” may express belief that x is happiness-conducive.
> “But ‘x is good’ is plausibly seen as expressing the speaker’s belief that x is happiness-conducive…”

**36.** Modified emotivism would be “x is good” means “x is happiness-conducive.”
> “…emotivism would be the view that ‘x is good’ means ‘x is happiness-conducive.’”

**37.** Thus modified, emotivism is blatantly false.
> “But, thus modified, emotivism is blatantly false.”

**38.** If “x is good” expresses a belief, it is true or false.
> “If it expresses any belief, ‘x is good’ is either true or false.”

**39.** The essence of emotivism is that moral statements express feelings, not judgments.
> “The essence of emotivism is that ‘x is good’ expresses a feeling, as opposed to a judgment…”

**40.** Therefore, modified emotivism collapses into its opposite.
> “So emotivism collapses into its opposite if it’s modified along the lines suggested by Hume.”

**41.** Modified emotivism coincides with utilitarianism.
> “thus modified, emotivism coincides with utilitarianism.”

**42.** Hume’s analysis (HA) is viciously circular.
> “What is more, HA is viciously circular.”

**43.** In assuming others would like music, I assume they aren’t damaged.
> “…in assuming that others would like a given piece of music, what I’m assuming is that others would enjoy it provided that they weren’t damaged…”

**44.** Damage (e.g., drunkenness) makes one incapable of seeing merits.
> “…drunkenness or injury or some such made somebody incapable of enjoying the piece is different from saying that it made them incapable of seeing its merits.”

**45.** If enjoyment had no basis in the music’s virtues, it would be pure projection.
> “If his previous enjoyment of music had nothing to do with anything inherent in the music, his enjoyment of it was pure projection.”

**46.** Since a blow diminished Smith, his previous enjoyment involved awareness of merits.
> “…since he obviously was diminished by it, we have to say that his previous enjoyment of it did involve some awareness on his part of its merits.”

**47.** One must distinguish between enjoying something and being caused pleasure by it.
> “It’s crucial to distinguish between enjoying something, on the one hand, and being caused by it to experience pleasure, on the other.”

**48.** Being caused joy by X is not the same as enjoying X.
> “Here the G-minor ballad is causing me joy; but I’m not enjoying it.”

**49.** There’s a difference between being caused to feel good by X and enjoying X.
> “There’s a difference between being caused to feel good by X, on the one hand, and enjoying X, on the other.”

**50.** When this distinction is recognized, emotivism collapses.
> “When this distinction is given its due, emotivism collapses…”

**51.** Value-nihilism also collapses with this distinction.
> “…and so does every form of value-nihilism.”

**52.** Value-nihilism: “x is good” means nothing or means x is liked.
> “By ‘value-nihilism’ I mean any doctrine to the effect that ‘x is good’ either means nothing or means that x is liked or otherwise looked upon favorably…”

**53.** Not all reasons for feeling good are aesthetic.
> “Not all of those reasons are of an aesthetic nature.”

**54.** Smith’s positive feeling about his Picasso is not an aesthetic reaction.
> “The Picasso makes Smith feel good… But this reaction isn’t an aesthetic reaction.”

**55.** What makes Smith feel good is the painting’s social utility, not its artistry.
> “What makes him feel good is X’s being something that will get him a promotion… not because it’s a great work of art.”

**56.** No thing does causal work; a thing’s having a property does.
> “No thing does any causal work. What does do causal work is some thing’s having some property.”

**57.** It is X’s being impressive to employers that gets the promotion.
> “It is X’s being impressive to employers that gets Smith the promotion. X per se does nothing.”

**58.** A genuine aesthetic reaction is driven by a thing’s artistic merits.
> “…what makes Jones feel good is X’s having certain artistic merits.”

**59.** An aesthetic reaction is driven by a thing’s being a work of art.
> “An aesthetic reaction is one that is driven by a thing’s being a work of art.”

**60.** If there are aesthetic reactions, there are aesthetic facts.
> “So to the extent that there are aesthetic reactions, there are aesthetic facts…”

**61.** If there are aesthetic facts, we can be wrong about them.
> “If there are aesthetic facts, we can be wrong about them, just as we can be wrong about anything else.”

**62.** If there are aesthetic facts, value-nihilism is false regarding aesthetics.
> “So if there are aesthetic facts, value-nihilism is false, at least as far as aesthetic properties are concerned.”

**63.** The saying “there’s no disputing taste” is invoked against aesthetic facts.
> “Everyone knows the old saying: ‘there’s no disputing taste.’”

**64.** Believing in aesthetic facts is seen as saying people should like certain things.
> “…you are, in effect, saying that there are paintings, works of music, novels, and so on, that people should like.”

**65.** This viewpoint embodies several confusions.
> “This viewpoint embodies several confusions.”

**66.** Aesthetic facts don’t imply all works are comparable.
> “…it doesn’t follow that, given any two works of musical works… they are capable of being meaningfully compared.”

**67.** Works can be good in non-comparable ways.
> “they are good in non-comparable ways.”

**68.** Their goodness may be “incommensurable.”
> “The goodness of any one of them is ‘incommensurable’… with the goodness of either of the others.”

**69.** Not every musical work is as good as every other.
> “But that doesn’t mean that every musical work is as good as every other musical work.”

**70.** Some works within a genre are not as good as others.
> “There are musical works that, given the genre to which they belong, are supposed to be good in the same way… but aren’t good in that way…”

**71.** It’s obvious some composers are better than others.
> “In any case, it’s patently obvious that some composers are better than others.”

**72.** The author admits he was outclassed as a composer.
> “I found that I was seriously outclassed.”

**73.** Many musicians wish they were better composers.
> “Many a musician wishes that he were a better composer than he is.”

**74.** No musician can coherently believe all works are of equal merit.
> “And no such musician can coherently believe that no musical work is better than any other.”

**75.** If all works were equal, all composers would be equal.
> “For if all musical works were equal merit, then ex hypothesi all composers would be of equal merit.”

**76.** Moral nihilism fails for similar reasons as aesthetic nihilism.
> “Moral nihilism fails for much the same reasons that aesthetic nihilism fails.”

**77.** Liking a situation (S) doesn’t entail a moral reaction.
> “Given only that I like S, it doesn’t follow that I’m having a moral response to it.”

**78.** A moral reaction requires S’s moral properties cause the joy.
> “It’s only if S’s having such and such moral properties is what brings me joy that my liking S is a moral reaction to it.”

**79.** Exclaiming “hurray S!” expresses a moral reaction only if evoked by moral facts.
> “…expresses a moral reaction to S only to the extent that S’s being a moral fact is what evokes the emotion…”

**80.** There are moral reactions only if there are moral facts.
> “In general, there are moral reactions only to the extent that there are moral facts.”

**81.** If there are moral facts, emotivism collapses.
> “If there are moral facts, our feelings may or may not do them justice; and emotivism completely collapses.”

**82.** Sense-perceptions represent the world as being a certain way.

**83.** Sense-perceptions have truth-conditions.
> “…they have ‘truth-conditions’: they’re accurate iff the world satisfies certain conditions.”

**84.** Thoughts always represent things as being a certain way.
> “…our thoughts always represent things as being a certain way…”

**85.** The common view: emotions are neither true nor false.
> “Emotions can be healthy or unhealthy, but they cannot be true or false.”

**87.** Emotions typically involve presuppositions about the world.
> “Of course, emotions typically involve presuppositions about how the world is.”

**88.** You cannot be angry that Tim stole your bike unless you believe he did.
> “You cannot be angry that Tim stole your bicycle unless you believe that Tim stole your bicycle.”

**89.** The belief involved is true or false, but the emotion is not.
> “…your belief that Tim stole your bicycle is either true or false… But your anger at Tim’s (supposed) act of theft isn’t true or false…”

**90.** Emotions presuppose beliefs but aren’t themselves beliefs.
> “Emotions presuppose beliefs; but emotions aren’t themselves beliefs.”

**91.** What an emotion adds to a belief is not true or false.
> “What it adds may be important from a personal viewpoint; but it’s neither here nor there as far as your knowledge of the world is concerned.”

**92.** This view is attributed to David Hume.
> “The position just described was advocated by David Hume…”

**93.** Hume’s view is totally false.
> “Hume’s view, we will now see, is totally false.”

**94.** Emotions are true or false.
> “Emotions are true or false.”

**95.** The reason is that emotions are beliefs.
> “The reason is that, counterintuitive though it may seem, emotions are beliefs.”

**96.** We see taking a pill for a headache as normal.
> “If you have a headache, you’ll happily take a pill to get rid of it.”

**97.** We’d see taking a pill to wipe out emotions as self-lobotomizing.
> “But that is how we’d regard somebody who took a pill that wiped away all his unpleasant emotions.”

**98.** In the kidnapping case, you would not take a pill to remove anger.
> “Would you take it? Probably not.”

**99.** Your attitude wouldn’t be like taking aspirin for a headache.
> “Would your attitude towards taking it be comparable to your attitude towards taking an aspirin to get rid of a headache? Definitely not.”

**100.** You want the child found, not the anger gone.
> “What you want isn’t to get rid of the emotion. What you want is for the police to find your child.”

**101.** Finding the child is not merely a means to end anger.
> “For if it were, then their finding the child would just be a means to that end… But that isn’t what you’d do.”

**102.** You would choose finding your child over taking the pill.
> “If you had to choose between taking the pill and having the police find your child, you would, without any doubt, choose the latter.”

**103.** You might endure more anger if it helped find your child.
> “You’d even be willing to endure an intensification of your anger if you thought it might make it more likely that your child would be found.”

**104.** People want circumstances to change so emotions become inappropriate.
> “What they want is to change their circumstances in such a way that their unpleasant emotions no longer have a basis in them.”

**105.** People don’t want to “zap” emotions; they want the world to change.
> “People don’t want to ‘zap’ their anger or hate or pessimism. They want the world to change… that those emotions cease to be appropriate.”

**106.** Attitude toward emotions is like attitude toward senses: we want accurate representation.

**109.** Like perceptions, emotions have an object.
> “Like a sense-perception or thought, an emotion must have an object.”

**110.** You can’t just be angry; you’re angry *at* or *about* something.
> “You can’t just be angry. You’re angry at your boss for giving someone else the promotion.”

**111.** All emotions have propositional complements.
> “As previously stated, emotions have propositional complements.”

**112.** Anger at Tim is not identical with the belief he stole your bike.
> “Your anger at Tim isn’t identical with your belief that he stole your bicycle.”

**113.** Anger necessarily involves the belief.
> “…you’re being angry at him for doing this necessarily involves your having that belief.”

**114.** One component of anger is a belief; there is a second component.
> “So one component of your anger at Tim is your belief that he stole your bicycle. But there’s some second component to your anger.”

**115.** The second component separates believing from emoting.
> “…it’s this second component that separates simply believing something from emoting about it…”

**116.** It’s tempting to think the second component is just a feeling.
> “it’s tempting to think that this second component… is nothing more than a feeling of some kind.”

**117.** On that view, anger is belief plus negative feeling.
> “…your anger at Tim consists in (1) your belief that he stole your bicycle plus (2) a negative feeling…”

**118.** The association cannot be purely causal.
> “First of all, the mode of association cannot be purely causal.”

**119.** Causal distress from a belief doesn’t make it the object of emotion.
> “…it wouldn’t follow that you were angry that your parents were loving ones.”

**120.** Causing an emotion is not the same as being its object.
> “Given only that x is what caused so and so to have emotion y, it doesn’t follow that x is what… so and so is emoting about.”

**121.** Statement (A) does not say the same as statement (B).
> “(A) x caused so and so to have emotion y’ doesn’t say the same thing as (B) in having emotion y, so and so is emoting about x.”

**122.** Ben’s story illustrates what emotions are.
> “…a story from my own adolescence will help make it clear what emotions actually are.”

**123.** Ben was upset about his symptoms, not about playing soccer.
> “During these time-outs, Ben was upset. He was upset about his symptoms… But he wasn’t upset that he had played soccer.”

**124.** Ben was happy he played soccer.
> “That was the one thing he was happy about.”

**125.** Having a negative emotion about X isn’t being caused by X to have it.
> “This confirms that having a negative emotion about X isn’t the same thing as being caused by X to have a negative emotion.”

**126.** Ben was upset his illness prevented him from playing.
> “Another thing he was upset about was that his illness prevented him from playing soccer as much as he wanted to.”

**127.** If cured, Ben would be happy he could play without problems.
> “Ben would obviously be happy if he were cured… He’d be happy that he could play soccer without any problems…”

**128.** Ben’s happiness would be identical with recognizing he can gratify a desire.
> “I therefore propose that Ben’s being happy under that circumstance would be identical with his recognizing that he could do something he wanted to do.”

**129.** In an alternative universe without the desire, cure wouldn’t bring that happiness.
> “In W, when he finds out that he’s cured… he won’t realize that he can now gratify a previously frustrated desire… he doesn’t have that desire to begin with.”

**130.** A necessary condition for happiness is knowing a desire can be gratified.
> “…a necessary condition for Ben’s being happy that he can play soccer is that he knows himself to have some desire that… he is able to gratify.”

**131.** It is also a sufficient condition.
> “It’s also a sufficient condition.”

**132.** If cured and aware he can fulfill his dream, he must be happy.
> “If, in actuality, Ben were suddenly cured… and he thus realized he could fulfill his life’s dream… could he possibly not be happy? No…”

**133.** Happiness is the recognition that one can now gratify a desire.
> “Ben’s being happy that he can play soccer is his recognition that… he can now gratify an otherwise ungratifiable desire.”

**134.** The analysis extends to all emotions.
> “This analysis is easily extended to apply to all emotions.”

**135.** Fear involves believing a desire is jeopardized.
> “So, to fear her coming is for you to believe that her coming would frustrate some desire of yours.”

**136.** You could be wrong about the threat, but the belief is present.
> “…your fearing her possible visit involves your believing, not necessarily correctly, that her coming would… thwart a desire of yours.”

**137.** This confirms emotions are true or false beliefs.
> “And it actually bears out our main point, this being: emotions are true or false, since emotions are beliefs of sorts.”

**138.** Emotions are beliefs about the prospects of gratifying desires.
> “Emotions, then, are beliefs about the prospects of gratifying desires that one has.”

**139.** Positive emotion: belief prospects are good.
> “If the belief is that the prospects are good, the emotion is a positive one…”

**140.** Negative emotion: belief prospects are bad.
> “If the belief is that those prospects are bad, it’s a negative one…”

**141.** Geach put forth a clever argument against emotivism.
> “Peter Geach put forth the following, very clever argument against emotivism…”

**142.** Geach’s argument (GA) substitutes “boo stealing!” for “stealing is wrong.”
> “Suppose that saying ‘stealing is wrong’ is… no different from saying ‘boo stealing!’…”

**143.** (1) “If stealing is wrong, then getting your little brother to steal is wrong.”
> (Quoted directly from GA).

**144.** (2) “If boo stealing!, then getting your little brother to steal is wrong.”
> (Quoted directly from GA).

**145.** Replacing with a synonym shouldn’t turn meaning into nonsense.
> “Replacing an expression with a synonymous expression doesn’t turn meaning into nonsense…”

**146.** (1) is meaningful; (2) is nonsense.
> “But whereas (1) is obviously meaningful… (2) is complete nonsense.”

**147.** Therefore, the expressions are not synonymous; emotivism is wrong.
> “Thus, the underlined expressions are not synonymous, and the emotivist is wrong to say otherwise.”

**148.** If emotions are beliefs, Geach’s argument fails.
> “Which makes it obvious that Geach’s argument fails if emotions are beliefs.”

**149.** Geach’s argument makes a strong, unargued, probably false assumption.
> “Which, in its turn, shows that it makes a strong, unargued, and probably false assumption.”

**150.** Therefore, Geach’s argument is spurious.
> “Which, finally, shows that it’s spurious.”
