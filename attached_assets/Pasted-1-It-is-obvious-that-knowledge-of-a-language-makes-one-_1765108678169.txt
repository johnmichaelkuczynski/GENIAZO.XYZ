1. It is obvious that knowledge of a language makes one more intelligent in at least some respects.
2. Knowledge of a language makes one more intelligent in at least some respects.
3. Authoritarian governments tend to be less responsive to the needs of their constituents than democratic governments.
4. One could not grasp that thought without knowing some language or other.
5. We have at least some inclination to say that one could not grasp that thought without knowing some language.
6. We are reluctant to regard creatures that cannot interact with reality through a language as capable of grasping abstract principles.
7. We are reluctant to regard language-less creatures as capable of thinking about reality in a discursive manner.
8. Whatever one can grasp through language, one must be able to grasp independently of language.
9. This view (that thought is independent of language) is counterintuitive.
10. Our untutored intuitions incline us to hold that without knowledge of a language a creature would be incapable of thinking discursively.
11. Untutored intuitions are not always probative.
12. Sometimes untutored intuitions are inconsistent with one another.
13. We strongly feel that we sometimes have thoughts of considerable sophistication that we don’t know how to put into words.
14. Not all discursive thought is language-dependent.
15. The purpose of the chapter is to answer the question: Do we think in language?
16. We do not think in language.
17. There are two very different versions of the view that we think in language.
18. Version #1: People think in the natural languages that they learn (English speakers in English, etc.).
19. A natural language is one that organically arises through human interactions.
20. Artificial languages are invented (e.g., by programmers or philosophers).
21. Version #2: We think in an innately known code, a “language of thought.”
22. In Version #2, the sentences of thought belong to a hard-wired system of symbolism.
23. Version #1 is wrong.
24. We can have thoughts that we are incapable of putting into words.
25. We grasp those thoughts in some way other than by grasping the sentences that express them.
26. There are occasions where putting a thought into words requires great effort.
27. Thinking is often a prerequisite to using language.
28. At least some thinking is non-linguistic.
29. Many authors (e.g., Wittgenstein, Blackburn, McDowell) deny that we know anything that we can’t readily articulate.
30. “If you can’t say it, you don’t know it.”
31. A person’s beliefs can be expressed in many ways, not all linguistic.
32. Knowledge can be expressed in drawings, movements, or other non-linguistic manners.
33. Accurate painting involves bona fide knowledge, not pseudo-knowledge.
34. Some kinds of information (e.g., visual) seem inherently incapable of being fully expressed by sentences of natural languages.
35. Sentences have very different structures from pictures.
36. Sentences are digital structures (decompose into discrete parts).
37. Sense-perceptions are analogue structures (do not decompose into discrete parts).
38. Any sentence must be interpreted to be understood.
39. Perceptions are self-interpreting in a way that sentences are not.
40. In order to learn a language, one must already be able to think.
41. Learning a language presupposes the ability to synthesize information and make judgments.
42. Knowledge of a language presupposes the ability to think.
43. Different sentences can have the same meaning.
44. A single sentence can have multiple meanings.
45. “Bob loves Mary” and “Mary is loved by Bob” have the same meaning but are different sentences.
46. If we thought in sentences, those would constitute different beliefs, but they do not.
47. We can disambiguate ambiguous sentences, which would be impossible if thoughts were identical with sentence-occurrences.
48. People who speak different languages can have the same thoughts.
49. Understanding sentences involves thought.
50. Understanding a sentence is different from its flashing through your mind.
51. Version #2 (language of thought) is false.
52. We often think in images (visual and auditory).
53. Images have a structure fundamentally different from sentences.
54. Knowing a language involves understanding its expressions and their semantic rules.
55. It is viciously circular to hold that thought depends on an innate code whose rules must be understood.
56. Advocates say we don’t understand the innate sentences; we are merely built to conform to them.
57. If sentences aren’t understood, they aren’t functioning as sentences.
58. We don’t think in language, even an innate one.
59. Mental images (icons) on a computer desktop represent changes in electrical activity.
60. Thoughts often take the form of a voice or mental images of spoken words.
61. People think with the help of visual imagery.
62. Mental images are not identical with the ratiocinative activities they facilitate.
63. Images need only be sufficiently differentiated to avoid confusion.
64. Ratiocinative activity cannot be identical with any sequence of images.
65. Everything constitutive of consciousness seems image-like or phenomenologically pregnant.
66. Wittgenstein concluded that thinking isn’t a private psychological act.
67. Thinking consists of engaging in overt behaviors involving public language symbols.
68. Wittgenstein’s position is absurd.
69. Thoughts, unlike itches and tickles, aren’t phenomenologically pregnant.
70. Wittgenstein’s mistake is similar to Hume’s on personal identity.
71. Thinking is a psychological process.
72. Mental imagery facilitates thought.
73. Mental images allow us to manage thought-processes that we otherwise couldn’t manage.
74. Consciousness integrates otherwise isolated streams of cognitive activity.
75. Knowledge of a language provides a rich system of icons for managing cognitive activities.
76. Wittgenstein contended that there cannot be a private language.
77. Private codes must be translations of public languages.
78. A single person can use a public language privately, but it’s parasitic on public use.
79. It is logically impossible for a solitary individual to create a language.
80. One cannot think unless one knows a language.
81. Knowledge of a language is prerequisite for reasoning.
82. Thinking requires being embedded in a society.
83. Wittgenstein’s Private Language Argument (PLA) argues there cannot be private languages.
84. Rule-following arguments show one cannot think without language.
85. Not all ideation is ratiocinative.
86. Ratiocinative ideation must be rule-governed.
87. Thinking involves following rules.
88. There is no psychological condition that necessarily accompanies rule-following.
89. Following a rule is not a psychological act.
90. Not all mental states are images or sensations.
91. Beliefs are stable, enduring structures, not fleeting events.
92. Meanings are themselves symbols.
93. Positing meanings to explain symbol-comprehension is circular (like the homunculus fallacy).
94. Wittgenstein’s argument resembles Aristotle’s Third Man Argument.
95. Properties are not instances of themselves.
96. Meanings are not themselves understood or interpreted.
97. Meanings are grasped or not grasped.
98. There is no gap between grasping a meaning and applying it (to the extent grasp is determinative).
99. Principles aren’t interpreted; they’re grasped and guide judgments.
100. The Private Language Argument imagines a solitary person creating a language.
101. In a private language, expressions mean whatever the person thinks they mean.
102. A symbol that can’t be used wrongly doesn’t mean anything.
103. Languages require right and wrong ways of use, which require multiple people.
104. All languages are public.
105. The Private Language Argument is spurious.
106. Expressions are meaningful because people remember what they mean.
107. Forgetting semantic rules renders a language useless to the individual.
108. If a person changes meanings, they create a new language.
109. Thinking involves following rules.
110. Rule-following is a psychological act.
111. Thought is a psychological act.
112. A prerequisite for speaking a language is knowing its semantic rules.
113. Thought mediates meaningful use of language.
114. Wittgenstein’s arguments for his conclusions are not probative.
115. We have no good reason to accept Wittgenstein’s position that thought consists in manipulating public symbols.

117. Not all thought involves the use of a public language.
118. We don’t think in an innate language or code.

120. Wittgenstein held there cannot be a private language.
121. Wittgenstein held one cannot think without knowing a language.
122. Meanings don’t have to be interpreted.
123. Visual perceptions are analogue, sentences are digital.
124. Learning language requires prior thought.
125. Same thoughts can be expressed in different languages.

132. Private languages are possible.
133. Solitary individuals can think.
134. Meanings are grasped directly, not interpreted.
135. Semantic rules determine meaning independently of ongoing interpretation.
136. Understanding a sentence requires more than mere imagery of it.
137. Thoughts precede and enable language acquisition.
138. Ambiguous sentences can be disambiguated non-linguistically.
139. Non-linguistic expression of knowledge is possible (e.g., drawing).
140. Visual information cannot be fully captured linguistically.
141. Perceptions do not require interpretation like sentences do.
142. Knowledge of language enhances cognition by providing manipulable icons.
143. Mental images serve as surrogates for concepts.
144. Wittgenstein wrongly infers thought is public behavior.
145. Wittgenstein’s rule-following arguments fail because they assume all mental states are phenomenal.

147. Changing intended meanings creates a new language, not arbitrary meaning in the old one.
148. Public languages are causally entrenched but not logically different from private ones.
149. Thought is independent of public language.
150. We do not think in words, whether public or innate.
