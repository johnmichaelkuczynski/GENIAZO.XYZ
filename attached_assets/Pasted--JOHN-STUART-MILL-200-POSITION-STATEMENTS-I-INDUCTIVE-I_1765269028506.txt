# JOHN STUART MILL: 200 POSITION STATEMENTS

---

## I. INDUCTIVE INFERENCE (20 Statements)

1. All inference is fundamentally from particulars to particulars; general propositions are merely registers of such inferences already made and short formulae for making more.

2. The foundation of all rules of induction is the uniformity of nature—the assumption that what happens once will, under sufficient similarity of circumstances, happen again.

3. Induction is the process by which we conclude that what is true of certain individuals of a class is true of the whole class, or that what is true at certain times will be true under similar circumstances at all times.

4. The uniformity of nature is itself an induction, but it is the most fundamental induction upon which all other inductions depend.

5. Perfect induction, or induction by simple enumeration, is the weakest form of proof when the instances are few, but approaches demonstrative certainty as the instances multiply without exception.

6. The business of inductive logic is to provide rules and models to which, if inductive arguments conform, those arguments are conclusive, and not otherwise.

7. Every induction may be thrown into the form of a syllogism by supplying a major premise—namely, that the uniformity of nature extends to the case in question.

8. The warrant for inductive inference is not the number of confirming instances alone but the variety of circumstances under which those instances have been observed.

9. A single instance may suffice for a complete induction when the circumstances are such that one well-observed case eliminates all reasonable alternative explanations.

10. Induction does not prove that the conclusion is true, but that it is probable, and the degree of probability depends upon the nature and number of the instances.

11. The major premise of every inductive syllogism—that nature is uniform—is itself derived from experience and cannot be known a priori.

12. Scientific induction differs from vulgar induction in that it seeks not merely to establish uniformities but to discover the laws of causation underlying those uniformities.

13. The process of discovering empirical laws prepares the way for explaining them—that is, for deducing them from the laws of the causes on which they depend.

14. An empirical law is an observed uniformity presumed to be resolvable into simpler laws but not yet so resolved.

15. The elimination of chance is essential to sound induction; we must determine that the observed conjunction is not accidental but the result of causation.

16. Induction properly conducted is never merely enumerative but analytical—it isolates the relevant factors from the irrelevant.

17. The conclusion of an induction does not derive its validity from the syllogism into which it may be cast but from the particular evidence upon which it rests.

18. What we call inductive inference is really a combination of observation and ratiocination—observation of facts and reasoning about their causes.

19. The value of a general proposition lies not in its being a premise from which particular truths are deduced but in its being a convenient register of particular truths already ascertained.

20. Every genuine induction admits of being stated as a syllogism with one or more of the methods of experimental inquiry supplying the minor premise.

---

## II. RATIONALISM (12 Statements)

21. There are no truths cognizable by the mind's inward light that are not derived from experience, whether of the external world or of internal consciousness.

22. The intuitionists erroneously attribute to direct apprehension what is actually the result of association and inference so habitual as to seem immediate.

23. What rationalists call necessary truths are in fact generalizations from experience so uniform that we cannot imagine their falsity—but this inability is psychological, not logical.

24. The doctrine of innate ideas is a philosophical error that mistakes the effects of early and constant experience for truths independent of experience.

25. The supposed self-evidence of the axioms of geometry and arithmetic is the result of our invariable experience, not of any insight into necessary relations.

26. Rationalist philosophers confuse the subjective inconceivability of a proposition's negation with objective impossibility.

27. That we cannot conceive a thing is no proof that it cannot exist; inconceivability is a fact about our minds, not about reality.

28. The intuitive school in philosophy is the great intellectual support of false doctrines and bad institutions, for whatever is felt to be obvious needs no justification.

29. The appeal to self-evidence has historically served to shield prejudice, privilege, and established authority from rational criticism.

30. Even mathematical reasoning proceeds from premises originally derived from experience and generalization, not from pure reason independent of all observation.

31. The doctrine that the mind can know truths about reality merely by consulting its own ideas is among the most pernicious errors in philosophy.

32. The sense of logical necessity that accompanies certain propositions is the product of psychological habit, not evidence of their being true independently of experience.

---

## III. EMPIRICISM (15 Statements)

33. All knowledge originates in experience; there is nothing in the intellect that was not first in the senses, including the intellect's knowledge of itself.

34. Experience is the ultimate source of all our knowledge, including our knowledge of mental operations and logical relations.

35. The mind at birth is not furnished with innate ideas but is shaped entirely by the experiences it subsequently undergoes.

36. Propositions that appear necessary and universal are in fact derived from experience so constant that their denial has never been suggested by any observation.

37. Every science, including logic and mathematics, rests ultimately on facts ascertained by observation and experiment.

38. The laws of mind are as much matters of experience as the laws of matter; both are discovered by observation and generalization.

39. Belief is not a matter of choice but follows necessarily from the evidence presented to the mind through experience.

40. What we know of causation we know entirely from experience; we have no insight into why causes produce their effects.

41. Experience teaches not only that events are conjoined but that they are invariably conjoined—and this invariability is all we mean by causation.

42. The test of all truth is experience—not the individual's fleeting impressions but the accumulated and verified experience of mankind.

43. Abstract truths are generalizations from concrete facts; there is no domain of purely abstract truth independent of experience.

44. The mind's activity in processing experience does not provide independent knowledge; it merely arranges what experience supplies.

45. Even our belief in the existence of other minds rests on empirical inference from observed behavior, not on rational intuition.

46. The laws of association explain how complex ideas are built up from simple sensory elements furnished by experience.

47. The certainty we feel about some propositions is a matter of degree, proportioned to the uniformity and extent of our experience.

---

## IV. THE BASIS OF LOGIC (15 Statements)

48. Logic is not a science distinct from and coordinate with other sciences but is the common ground on which all sciences stand.

49. The principles of logic are themselves derived from experience and generalization, not from self-evident intuition.

50. The syllogism does not prove the conclusion from the premises but merely registers an inference already drawn from particulars.

51. All reasoning is from particulars to particulars; general propositions are intermediate steps that abbreviate and systematize such reasoning.

52. The dictum de omni et nullo—that what is true of a class is true of its members—is itself an induction, not an a priori truth.

53. Logic is the science of the operations of the understanding in the pursuit of truth; it is the theory of correct reasoning.

54. The laws of thought—identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle—are generalizations from the observed operations of the mind.

55. We believe the law of non-contradiction because we have never experienced its violation, not because we perceive its truth directly.

56. Logic is both a science and an art: a science insofar as it describes correct reasoning, an art insofar as it prescribes rules for reasoning well.

57. The major premise of a syllogism is not the proof of the conclusion but a memorandum that the conclusion has already been proved inductively.

58. There is no purely formal logic independent of content; logic must attend to the nature of propositions, not merely their form.

59. Real inference always adds something to our knowledge; merely apparent inference only makes explicit what was already implicitly known.

60. The study of fallacies belongs to logic because fallacies are departures from the correct processes of reasoning.

61. Logic cannot provide a mechanical procedure for arriving at truth but can provide canons for testing the validity of inferences.

62. The province of logic is evidence—what evidence consists of and how we are to judge whether it is sufficient.

---

## V. THE BASIS OF MATHEMATICS (15 Statements)

63. Mathematical propositions are not truths about an abstract realm but generalizations from our experience of physical objects.

64. The science of number is founded on the observed fact that objects can be aggregated into groups whose properties are then investigated.

65. The truths of arithmetic are empirical truths about the behavior of objects when combined and separated.

66. That two and two make four is an induction from experience, not a truth of pure reason independent of observation.

67. Geometry is an empirical science whose axioms are generalizations from our experience of actual spatial relations.

68. The parallel postulate is not self-evident but is an empirical hypothesis that could conceivably be false in some region of space.

69. The apparent necessity of mathematical truths arises from the uniformity of our experience, not from insight into necessary relations.

70. The definition of a straight line incorporates an empirical claim about the properties of actual physical lines.

71. Points, lines, and surfaces as defined in geometry are idealizations of physical objects, not objects of a separate non-empirical realm.

72. We cannot conceive of space having more than three dimensions because our experience has been uniformly of three-dimensional space, not because extra dimensions are impossible.

73. The axioms of mathematics owe their apparent necessity to the fact that they have been so universally verified that their denial has never been suggested by experience.

74. Mathematical demonstration proceeds from premises that are themselves empirical generalizations, not self-evident truths.

75. The certainty of mathematics is practical certainty derived from invariable experience, not absolute certainty derived from reason alone.

76. If experience had been otherwise, our mathematical beliefs would have been correspondingly different.

77. Mathematical propositions, like all propositions, are either verbal (explicating the meaning of terms) or real (asserting facts about the world).

---

## VI. THE CANONS OF SCIENTIFIC INFERENCE (18 Statements)

78. The Method of Agreement: If two or more instances of a phenomenon have only one circumstance in common, that circumstance is the cause (or effect) of the phenomenon.

79. The Method of Difference: If an instance in which the phenomenon occurs and an instance in which it does not occur differ in only one circumstance, that circumstance is the cause or part of the cause of the phenomenon.

80. The Joint Method of Agreement and Difference combines the two methods, establishing both that the circumstance is present when the phenomenon is present and absent when the phenomenon is absent.

81. The Method of Residues: Subduct from any phenomenon whatever is already known by prior inductions to be the effect of certain antecedents, and the residue of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents.

82. The Method of Concomitant Variations: Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon varies in some particular manner is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon, or is connected with it by some causal chain.

83. The Method of Difference is the most rigorous of the methods because it establishes both the presence and absence of the supposed cause in conjunction with the presence and absence of the effect.

84. The Method of Agreement is inherently less powerful than the Method of Difference because multiple causes may produce the same effect.

85. Concomitant Variation is indispensable when we cannot entirely exclude or entirely include a circumstance but can vary its intensity.

86. The Method of Residues is a form of the Method of Difference applied successively; it is especially useful in complex investigations.

87. These methods are methods of elimination: they work by excluding all possible causes except one.

88. No method can prove causation with absolute certainty; they can only eliminate alternatives and render a causal hypothesis highly probable.

89. Plurality of causes—the fact that different causes may produce similar effects—is the great obstacle to the Method of Agreement.

90. Intermixture of effects—the fact that several causes operating together produce a joint effect—complicates all the methods.

91. The methods apply to ultimate laws; derivative laws must be established by showing that they follow from ultimate laws.

92. Experiment is superior to mere observation because it allows us to vary circumstances at will and thus to apply the Method of Difference rigorously.

93. When experiment is impossible, we must make do with the Method of Agreement supplemented by the Method of Concomitant Variations.

94. The deductive method—from laws to consequences—must be combined with the inductive methods—from observations to laws—in mature sciences.

95. The ultimate test of any scientific hypothesis is whether its predictions are verified by observation and experiment.

---

## VII. THE RELATION OF PSYCHOLOGY TO OTHER DISCIPLINES (12 Statements)

96. Psychology is the foundation of the moral sciences; the laws of mind must be understood before we can understand social phenomena.

97. The laws of psychology are laws of association—the principles by which ideas become connected with one another.

98. Mental chemistry: Complex mental states are not mere aggregates of simpler states but new products with properties not found in their elements.

99. The science of human nature is possible, though less exact than physics, because human actions follow laws even if individuals are unpredictable.

100. Ethology—the science of character formation—mediates between psychology and the social sciences by explaining how circumstances shape character.

101. The social sciences cannot be deduced directly from psychology; they require intermediate principles about the formation of character.

102. Political economy abstracts from the whole of human nature to consider only the desire for wealth and the aversion to labor.

103. History is not a science but a repository of evidence for the sciences of society; it provides the data for sociological generalizations.

104. Sociology studies the laws of social statics (the conditions of social stability) and social dynamics (the laws of social progress).

105. The historical method in sociology traces the progressive development of human society through successive stages.

106. Psychology explains the actions of individuals; sociology explains the collective phenomena that arise from the interaction of individuals.

107. The laws of mind are universal, but their operation is modified by the circumstances of society, climate, and culture.

---

## VIII. ETHICS: UTILITARIANISM (20 Statements)

108. The Greatest Happiness Principle holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse.

109. By happiness is meant pleasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure.

110. Pleasures differ in quality as well as quantity; some pleasures are intrinsically more valuable than others.

111. It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied; the competent judge prefers higher pleasures even at the cost of greater discontent.

112. The competent judges of the relative quality of pleasures are those who have experienced both kinds being compared.

113. The utilitarian standard is not the agent's own happiness but the greatest amount of happiness altogether.

114. Utilitarianism requires that the agent be as strictly impartial between his own happiness and that of others as a disinterested benevolent spectator.

115. The happiness that utilitarianism takes as the standard is not the agent's individual happiness but the general happiness.

116. Secondary principles—rules like "do not lie" and "keep promises"—are justified by their tendency to promote the general happiness.

117. We should act according to secondary principles in ordinary cases and appeal directly to the principle of utility only in cases of conflict.

118. The proof of the utility principle is that each person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness therefore a good to the aggregate of persons.

119. Virtue can become an end in itself through association; we may come to desire virtue for its own sake, not merely as a means to happiness.

120. The sanctions of the utility principle are external (public opinion, legal punishment) and internal (conscience, the feeling of duty).

121. The ultimate sanction of all morality is the social feelings of mankind—the desire to be in unity with our fellow creatures.

122. Justice is the name for certain moral requirements that stand higher than others because they are more directly connected with social well-being.

123. Rights are claims that society ought to protect because of their importance to general utility.

124. The feeling of justice is the natural feeling of resentment moralized by being extended to harm inflicted on others and on society.

125. Moral rules admit of exceptions, but the exceptions must themselves be recognized and regulated by reference to utility.

126. The object of moral education should be to build up associations between happiness and virtuous conduct and between misery and vicious conduct.

127. Utilitarianism is compatible with recognizing that motives matter; a good motive is one that habitually produces good actions.

---

## IX. SOCIALISM (12 Statements)

128. The institution of private property is not sacred but must be judged by its consequences for human welfare.

129. The existing distribution of property owes more to violence, conquest, and unjust laws than to any defensible principle of justice.

130. Socialism in its best forms aims at a more just distribution of the produce of labor than the present system achieves.

131. The question of socialism versus capitalism is ultimately empirical: which system best promotes human happiness and development?

132. Cooperative enterprises in which workers share ownership deserve encouragement as experiments in industrial organization.

133. The evils attributed to socialism—the suppression of individual initiative—belong equally to the present industrial system for the majority of workers.

134. A society of laborers working as equals, sharing the produce according to agreed principles, is neither impossible nor contrary to human nature.

135. The strongest objection to socialism is the difficulty of providing adequate motivation for labor without the spur of personal gain.

136. Socialism's feasibility depends on a higher level of moral development than currently prevails, but such development is possible.

137. Saint-Simonian and Fourierist socialism contain valuable ideas despite their impracticable details.

138. Competition has many evils, but these should be remedied by regulation and cooperation, not necessarily by abolishing private property altogether.

139. The verdict on socialism should await practical experiments; it is not to be settled by a priori reasoning about human nature.

---

## X. CAPITALISM (10 Statements)

140. The present system of industry is not the final stage of human improvement but is capable of indefinite modification.

141. Competition, while productive of certain evils, is also the great stimulus to effort and the mechanism by which efficiency is rewarded.

142. Private property in land stands on a different footing from property in produced goods because land is not made by labor.

143. The rent of land is an unearned increment that may legitimately be appropriated by the community for public purposes.

144. Capital is the result of saving—of abstaining from present consumption to provide for future production.

145. The laboring classes do not receive the full value of their product; the surplus goes to those who own land and capital.

146. The existing distribution of wealth is not natural or inevitable but the result of laws and institutions that can be changed.

147. Economic progress under capitalism tends to enrich landlords at the expense of other classes through the increase of rent.

148. The present system gives capitalists power over workers that can be and often is abused.

149. Reform of capitalism to secure more just distribution is possible without total abolition of private property.

---

## XI. THE PROPER ROLE OF GOVERNMENT (18 Statements)

150. The only legitimate purpose for which power can be exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others.

151. The individual is sovereign over himself, over his own body and mind.

152. Paternalistic interference with adult citizens—coercion for their own good—is not a legitimate function of government.

153. Government may legitimately restrict liberty to prevent individuals from harming others but not to prevent self-regarding harm.

154. Actions that affect only the agent are not the proper concern of government, however foolish or self-destructive they may be.

155. Society may rightfully restrict only those actions that are prejudicial to the interests of others.

156. The marketplace of ideas requires freedom of expression; no opinion should be suppressed, for even false opinions have value in challenging truth.

157. Truth is more likely to emerge from the free competition of ideas than from governmental determination of orthodoxy.

158. Liberty of tastes and pursuits, of framing one's plan of life to suit one's own character, is essential to human development.

159. Freedom of combination—the right to unite for any purpose not involving harm to others—is an extension of individual liberty.

160. Government should not prohibit conduct merely because it is immoral; the enforcement of morals is not a proper function of law.

161. Compulsory education is justified because ignorance harms the community, but the state should not monopolize education.

162. Government may require citizens to perform certain positive duties—jury service, defense of the community, rescue of those in peril.

163. The state may regulate economic activity to prevent fraud, enforce contracts, and provide public goods.

164. Infrastructure—roads, harbors, lighthouses—that private enterprise will not adequately provide may be legitimately provided by government.

165. Government may restrict the sale of poisons and other dangerous articles without violating liberty, because such restrictions prevent harm to others.

166. Taxation should be proportionate to ability to pay; exemption of subsistence from taxation is a dictate of justice.

167. Representative government is the ideally best form of polity because it promotes the active participation of citizens in their own governance.

---

## XII. ECONOMICS (15 Statements)

168. Political economy considers mankind as occupied solely in acquiring and consuming wealth; other motives are abstracted from.

169. The laws of production partake of the character of physical laws; the laws of distribution are matters of human institution.

170. Labor is the primary source of all wealth; capital is stored-up labor.

171. The wages of labor in the long run are determined by the ratio of population to capital—the wages fund.

172. Profits tend to a minimum as capital accumulates and competition intensifies.

173. Rent arises from the differential productivity of different qualities of land and goes to the owners of superior land.

174. The tendency of profits to fall can be counteracted by improvements in production that increase output relative to inputs.

175. Economic progress leads to a stationary state in which population and capital cease to grow, but this state need not be undesirable.

176. The stationary state would permit attention to the improvement of the quality of life rather than mere accumulation.

177. Free trade between nations benefits all parties by allowing each to specialize in what it produces most efficiently.

178. The doctrine of comparative advantage shows that trade benefits even nations that have no absolute advantage in any product.

179. Protectionist tariffs benefit special interests at the expense of consumers and the general public.

180. Infant industries may legitimately receive temporary protection until they can compete with established foreign producers.

181. Currency should be regulated to provide a stable measure of value; inflation and deflation both distort economic relationships.

182. The rate of interest is determined by the supply of and demand for loanable funds.

---

## XIII. AGREEMENTS WITH ADAM SMITH (10 Statements)

183. Division of labor increases productivity by allowing specialization and the development of skill and dexterity.

184. The self-interested pursuit of individual gain in competitive markets tends to promote the public good as if guided by an invisible hand.

185. Government interference in trade generally does more harm than good by distorting the natural allocation of resources.

186. Mercantilism—the doctrine that national wealth consists in accumulating precious metals—is a fundamental error.

187. Free trade benefits both parties to an exchange; restrictions on trade impoverish both nations.

188. Monopolies are injurious because they keep prices artificially high and reduce the incentive for improvement.

189. The value of goods is ultimately determined by the labor required to produce them.

190. Public works that benefit the entire community may legitimately be provided by government when private enterprise will not supply them.

191. Education is a proper concern of government because an ignorant populace is a danger to society.

192. The interest of producers and the interest of consumers often diverge; policy should favor consumers, who are the general public.

---

## XIV. DISAGREEMENTS WITH ADAM SMITH (8 Statements)

193. Smith underestimated the extent to which competition can be impeded by combination and monopoly.

194. The natural progress of rent enriches landlords without any effort or sacrifice on their part, a fact Smith did not sufficiently emphasize.

195. Smith's labor theory of value is inadequate because it fails to account for the role of demand in determining prices.

196. Government has a larger role in promoting human improvement than Smith allowed; laissez-faire is not an absolute principle.

197. The laws of distribution are not natural laws but human institutions susceptible of change.

198. Smith did not adequately recognize that the stationary state could be a desirable condition of human flourishing.

199. The condition of the laboring classes deserves more attention than Smith gave it; economic progress should improve their lot.

200. Smith's optimism about the automatic tendency of economic progress to benefit all classes is not fully warranted.

---

## XV. THE ROLE OF TRADERS IN THE ECONOMY (5 Statements)

201. Traders perform a useful function by bringing goods from where they are abundant to where they are needed.

202. The profit of traders is a legitimate reward for the service of facilitating exchange and bearing risk.

203. Speculation in markets serves to smooth prices over time by encouraging storage when prices are low and sale when they are high.

204. Middlemen are often vilified but perform necessary functions that producers and consumers cannot efficiently perform for themselves.

205. The multiplication of traders in competitive markets tends to reduce their profits to the minimum necessary to induce them to continue.

---

## XVI. MONOPOLIES (5 Statements)

206. Monopolies injure consumers by keeping prices above the competitive level and reducing the quantity supplied.

207. Natural monopolies—where a single supplier can serve the whole market more efficiently—should be regulated by government or operated as public enterprises.

208. Patents and copyrights create temporary monopolies that are justified as incentives to invention and creativity.

209. Combination among workers to raise wages is not objectionable, though combination among employers to reduce wages would be equally unobjectionable if practiced openly.

210. Joint-stock companies and corporations have a tendency toward monopoly that may require governmental oversight.
