Part 3 Final Exam      Part 1: Basic Principles 


       Lecture 1 What is an economy?


 


      Economics studies the generation and allocation of commercial


resources. A commercial resource is anything that a person can use or


own. Suppose that there were only three people in existence, Smith,


Jones, and Brown. Smith grows crops, Brown builds huts and bridges,


and Jones hunts. Smith, Jones, and Brown exchange the fruits of their


labor, and this arrangement is stable. This is an economy.


       Quiz


 


      True or false? If Smith, Jones and Brown each created products, but


they refused to trade with one another or in any benefit from one another's


labors, they would jointly constitute an economy.


 


      Answer: False


      Explanation: There is no economy where there is no trade.


 


      If Smith, Jones, and Brown each created products and they traded


those products with one another, they would jointly constitute an economy.


 


      Answer: True


      Explanation: There is an economy wherever there is trade.


 


       Lecture 2 Economies in Relation to Currency


 


      An economy is therefore any plurality of people who provide goods


and services for one another. Sometimes currency is involved; sometimes


it is not.


      Currency is money. Money is a certificate of wealth that is not


itself of any value. Dollar bills have no value in and of themselves. Their


value is purely conventional in nature. But dollar bills can be used to buy


food and cars and other valuables.


       Quiz


 


Which of the following statements is true?


a.           If ten different people all love each other but they do not exchange


goods and services with one another, they constitute an economy.


b.           If ten different people all hate each other but they exchange goods and


services with one another, they constitute an economy.


c.           In order for there to be a working economy, there must be currency of


some kind.


d.           All property is stolen from our children and there are therefore no


genuinely functional economies.


e.           All of the above.


 


      Answer: b


      Explanation: Wherever people exchange goods and services, there is


an economy. All other factors are irrelevant.


       Lecture 3 Efficiency and the Division of Labor


 


      If you try to do everything yourself, you will work very hard and


your standard of living will be very low. Suppose that you had to build


your own lodging, grow your own crops, hunt for for your own game,


build your own farming and hunting equipment, and so on. How well


would you live? Not well. How long would you live? Not long.


      In order to live well, labor must be efficient. That means that a


small amount of work must yield a large amount of value. "Value" is


anything that is desired. The term has no moral connotations. Lodging has


value. Clothing has value. If you like to play the piano, then pianos have


value, at least for you.


      In order for a small amount of work to yield a large amount of


value, there must be division of labor. In other words, different people


must do different things. Smith must hunt. Brown must grow crops. Jones


must build houses. Green must build farming and hunting utensils. And so


on.


      Then they must exchange the fruits of their labor. Smith gives beef


to Jones, and in exchange Jones builds (or maintains) a house for Smith.


Brown gives potatoes to Green, and in exchange Green builds (or fixes)


farming equipment for Brown. And so on.      Important principle of economics: The greater the division of labor,


the more efficient the economy. We will develop this point in the next


lecture.


       Quiz


      Which of the following statements is true?


      a.           If you tried to take care of all of your own needs, your life would


be easy and enjoyable.


      b.           In order to work at maximal efficiency, people must never


interact with one another.


      c.           A working economy requires a complete lack of autonomy on


the part of all of its members.


      d.           An efficient economy involves different people performing


different tasks and then exchanging goods and services with one another.


 


      Answer: d


      Explanation: where there is no division of labor, work is prohibitively


inefficient.


 


       Lecture 4 Economics Defined


      We have considered two different economic arrangements. In one


of them, people do not cooperate. In the other, they do cooperate.


      We have seen that the first does not work very well. An 'economy


of one' is not a very efficient economy. A world of total 'do-it-your-


selfers' is a world of people who work hard, live badly, and die young.


      We have seen that when people work together, their work tends to


be relatively efficient and they can live relatively well.


      The discipline of economics is not interested in economies of one.


Economics is only interested in economies that involve cooperation


between different people.


      But there are many different kinds of cooperative arrangements,


and they differ dramatically from one another. Some of them work very


well; others work very poorly.


      Economics tries to answer the question: Which such arrangements


work well, and which ones don't? In other words, which such


arrangements generate and allocate resources efficiently and in which


ones fail to do so?


      Thus, economics is the discipline that identifies the circumstances


under which resources are generated and allocated with maximal


efficiency.       Quiz


Which of the following statements is true?


a.           Economists would favor traditional gender relations even if they led to


economic inefficiency.


b.           Economists would favor democratic political systems even if they led


to economic inefficiency.


c.           Economists would favor democratic political systems only if they led


to economic efficiency.


d.           Without the use of fossil fuels and heavy industry, there cannot exist an


economy.


e.           None of the above.


Answer: c


Explanation: Economics is concerned with politics, including questions of


political justice, only to the extent that they impact economic efficiency.


Corollary: economics often supplies otherwise empty propositions of ethics


and politics with operational definitions that give empirical content to those


propositions.Lecture 5 Currency


 


      Goods and services can be exchange in one of two ways: directly


and indirectly.


      If I give you a boat in exchange for a car, you have directly


exchanged a car for a boat.


      If I give you money in exchange for a car and you then use that


money to buy a boat, you have exchanged a car for a boat, but the


exchange was indirect, since it involved the intermediary of money.


      Money is anything that has little or no intrinsic value but that


serves as a medium of exchange.


      Historically, many things have functioned as currency: bags of salt,


pebbles, twigs, hunks of gold, and gold coins.


      Even though some of these things, e.g. salt and twigs, may have


some intrinsic value, they are not functioning as money as long unless


their exchange-value exceeds their intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of


$100 bill is nil, as is that of a gold coin; but their exchange-values are


high. 


      Quiz


Which of the following statements is true?


 


a.           Pebbles, bags of salt, etc. are functioning as money only if their


exchange value equals their intrinsic value.


b.           Pebbles, bags of salt, etc. are functioning as money only if their


exchange value exceeds their intrinsic value.


 


Answer: b


Explanation:  It is only if a thing’s intrinsic value is trivial compared to its


value-in-exchange that it is functioning as money.  


       Lecture 6 Barter vs. Monetary Exchanges


 


      Direct exchanges are known as 'barter.' If I give you a boat for a


car, you and I are bartering.


      Bartering is fine in many contexts. But it has some limitations.


      If Smith has a car and needs a boat and Jones has a boat and needs


a car, it is unlikely that Smith's car will equal Jones' boat in value.


      Also, if each of Smith and Jones has both shortages and surpluses,


it is unlikely that what Jones has is what Smith needs or that what Smith


has is what Jones needs, and it is doubly unlikely that what each has and


is willing to give up is exactly what the other needs.


      So barter either results in someone getting less for more or it


requires that there are be an improbable 'double coincidence' of wants and


needs between the parties involved. (This term is due to W.S. Jevons, who


used it in his book Money as the Medium of Exchange.)


      In general, what a given person has and needs is unlikely to align,


either qualitatively or quantitatively, with another given person needs and


has.


       Quiz


Which of the following statements is true?


a.           Inflation is not possible in a barter economy.


b.           Inflation is possible in a barter economy.


 


Answer: a


Explanation: Inflation is when money is overvalued, and there is no money in


a barter economy.


       Part 2 Economies of Scale


       Lecture 7 Surpluses necessary for scale


 


      A surplus is when you have more of something than you need.


      A shortage is when you don't have enough of something that you


need.


      In order for an economy to be efficient, it must have large


surpluses. Suppose that each person only has just enough of food, just


enough lumber, just enough lodging, just enough energy to take care of


his own basic needs, etc. In this kind of economy, people wouldn't be able


to trade with one another, since they couldn't part with anything without


dying.


      Now consider a different economy. In this economy, some people


have extra food; other people don't have enough food but they have extra


medical supplies; some people have enough of both but they don't have


books or other things to keep them entertained; and so on. In this


economy, it is possible for people to improve one another's lives by


exchanging goods.


      The first 'economy' is really only an economy in name only. Where


margins are so thin that people have nothing to give, there is no trade and


no real economy.


      The second economy is a real economy. There are surpluses, sothere can be trade.


In general, trade is possible when there are surpluses. Moreover, trade is


possible to the extent that there are surpluses.      Quiz


Which of the following statements is true?


 


a.           Surpluses paralyze economic activity.


b.           Surpluses are necessary for economic activity.


c.           Both of the above.


d.           Neither of the above.


 


Answer: b


Explanation: There are no economies without trade, and there is no trade


without surpluses, since one only trades what one has a surplus of.


       Lecture 8 Different kinds of scale


      An economy of scale is simply a large economy.


      But there are different ways that an economy can be large.


      It can be large in a purely quantitative sense. It can consist of large


numbers of people, each of whom has a tiny surpluses: an extra loaf of


bread, a few minutes during the day when he doesn't have to working,


maybe even a drawing that he can look at for aesthetic enjoyment.


      If an economy of this kind of consisted of one trillion people, it


would technically be large. But it would not be a very good economy, and


it is not what economists mean when they talk about an 'economy of


scale.'


      To see what they do mean, let us consider a different kind of


economy.


      This time imagine a society of one million people. Let us refer to


this society as S.


      Some people in S have a great deal of extra food and extra clothes.


Others are struggling and at times may not even have enough to eat.


      But even those who are barely getting by often have surpluses of


one kind or another. Some of them may be very knowledgeable and may


have information that will help other people grow crops or build houses.


Others may have talents that could be sources of entertainment. And soon.


      People in S are not locked into just one job. They can try their hand


at different trades. They are allowed to switch jobs and they are also


allowed to start their own businesses.


        Consequently, S has a very fluid and dynamic labor market. When


people with surpluses of one kind are suffering from shortages of some


other kind, people in S who feel that they can address those shortages get


to work. If people who have extra food find themselves needing winter


coats, other people in S get to work and start making those coats and


exchanging them for food.


      This activity in its turn leads to more surpluses--and more


shortages. People with winter coats can work in the winter, hunting and


building houses, and the like. Those houses are exchanged but then need


repairs. Because of all these new houses, S needs more contractors and


plumbers than it currently has. So there is a shortage of such people. But


this shortage is addressed: people learn these trades and ply them.


      And the cycle continues.


       Quiz


Which of the following statements below is true?


a.           An economy in which people are not allowed to change the nature


of their work is likely to do a good job of addressing shortages.


b.           An efficient economy is one in which people don't change the way


that they respond to problems, even though those methods don't work.


c.           Economies of scale tend to result from efficiency and efficiency


tends to require a willingness to deal with problems in new ways.


d.           None of the above.


Answer: c


Explanation: Efficiency involves adaptation.


       Lecture 9 Literacy as the basis of economies of scale


 


      Writing was invented to keep records of supplies. Farmers who had


extra grain used hash-marks to represent bushels of grain. If they had


surpluses of other supplies, they used different symbols to represent them.


      These records enabled those farmers to know what they needed to


grow next season and what they did not need to grow.


      This increased efficiency, leading to more surpluses.


      These different methods of record keeping converged into systems


that were intelligible to large numbers of people.


      These common systems of writing were then used to record


transactions.


      At this point, they had two uses: recording supplies and recording


sales.


      Once sales-transactions were recorded, writing could be used to


write promissory notes (IOU's). This began happening a few hundred


years later.


      In the meantime, systems of became generalized. First it was to


record quantities of grain. Then quantities of other supplies, such as


shoes.


      Also, because writing is of its very nature abstract, it could not somuch as exist without bringing mathematics into existence. A single hash-


mark was used to represent one bushel; five hash-marks, five bushels; and


so on.


      It was immediately seen that one bushel plus one bushel equals two


bushels. It was soon recognized that the same principles applied to other


things: for example, that one house plus one house equals two houses. In


other words, one of anything plus one of that same thing equals two of


that thing. 1+1=2, in other words.


       Quiz


Question: Which of the following statements is true?


a.           Good records help people use their time and energy more efficiently.


b.           Good records make it hard for people to use their time and energy


efficiently.


c.           Neither of the above.


Answer: a


Explanation: Ignorance is inefficient, and records minimize ignorance.


       Lecture 10 Sales Records and Promissory Notes

       Quiz


Which of the following statements is true?


a.           Written records make it difficult keep track of loans and therefore


discourage investment.


b.           If no loans were made, there would be no debt and the economy would


therefore function at peak efficiency.


c.           Loans can stimulate economic development when they are made to


people whose activities generate value.


d.           All of the above


e.           None of the above.


Answer: c


Explanation: Without loans, people with viable business ideas would have to


spend that much more time accumulating start-up capital and that much less


time creating their businesses.


       Lecture 11 Debt-instruments


      Writing therefore made it easier for people to loan assets to others.


If there are no written records of loans, debtors are likely to lie about


what they owe and people will therefore unlikely to make loans. Not so if


there are written records.


        Consequently, people who needed capital (e.g. horses, food,


clothes, tools, labor) but did not at present have anything to exchange for


it could get loans.


      Since people seek loans when they know of economic opportunities


that they wish to capitalize on, this led to improvements in efficiency.


People who knew of a new crop that people would want but that only they


knew how to grow were able to do so, even if they did not at present have


anything to give in exchange for the necessary supplies.


      Capital is any asset that is used to generate anything of economic


value. 


      Quiz


Which of the following statements is true?


a.           "Capital" refers only to currency.


b.           "Capital" refers to assets that serve no economic purpose.


c.           "Capital" refers to assets that are intended to serve an economic


purpose.


d.           "Capital" refers to machinery but not to livestock or land.


e.           None of the above.


Answer: c


Explanation: None needed, as this is a definitional truth.


 


       Lecture 12 Mathematics as by-product of economies of scale


      In the meantime, systems of became generalized. First it was to


record quantities of grain. Then quantities of other supplies, such as


shoes.


      Also, because writing is of its very nature abstract, it could not so


much as exist without bringing mathematics into existence. A single hash-


mark was used to represent one bushel; five hash-marks, five bushels; and


so on.


      It was immediately seen that one bushel plus one bushel equals two


bushels. It was soon recognized that the same principles applied to other


things: for example, that one house plus one house equals two houses. In


other words, one of anything plus one of that same thing equals two of


that thing. 1+1=2, in other words.


       Quiz


Which of the following statements is true?


a.           Because written symbols are so abstract, the existence of writing has


had injurious effect on mathematical thought.


b.           Because written symbols are so abstract, the existence of writing has


had a positive effect on mathematical thought.


Answer: b


Explanation: mathematical thought concerns operations that tend to have no


observable counterparts and it therefore involves the ability to use non-iconic


symbols.


       Lecture 13 Interest and Investment


      When people make loans, they do so for a price. That price is


known as interest.


      If I loan you $10 now, I do so only because I believe that in the


future you will pay me back more than $10. That extra amount is the


interest on the loan.


      The same is true if I loan you my car. I do that only because you


promise that you will let me stay at your vacation house next summer.


That too is interest.


      Investment is when assets are loaned to people who are expected to


generate wealth and who for that reason are expected to return those loans


plus interest.


       Quiz


Which of the following statements is true?


a.           If I loan you money and do not charge interest, both of us benefit


economically.


b.           If I loan you money and do not charge interest, only you benefit


economically, since I cannot possibly end up ahead in that situation.


c.           Both of the above.


d.           None of the above.


 


       Lecture 13 Finance vs. Economics


      Finance studies the circumstances under which enterprises are


worth investing in and how to raise the funds needed to make the


necessary investments. In other words, finance answer the following two


questions: When should loans be made? And how can get the money


needed to make those loans?


      Economics answers the question: What kinds of social systems are


most likely to make it possible for there to be anything worth investing in


in the first place?


      Economists ask questions like the following: If we tax imports, will


that create wealth? If lower taxes on farmers, will that create wealth? If


create for-profit prisons, will that make society wealthier?


      Financiers don't ask these questions. Financiers don't get to work


until there is extra capital to throw around. If that capital doesn't exist,


there are no financiers. Once it does exist, they only direct towards


existing concerns. If Jones comes to a financier Brown and asks for


money, saying that he has a great business idea, and Smith also goes to


Brown asking for money, also saying that he has a great business idea,


Brown decides between Smith and Jones. He looks at their respective


plans, credit histories, and the like.


      If Brown is a highly cerebral financier, he may producegeneralizations about what kinds of businesses are likely to yield what


kinds of returns.


      What Brown does not do is ask how society would have to be


different in order to create investment opportunities. As a financier,


Brown only cares about what is, not what could be.


      The economist's job is to figure out how to tinker with society to


create opportunities for the likes of Smith, Jones, and Brown.


       Quiz


What does a financier do?


a.           Figure out how to make society more just.


b.           Create goods and services without worrying about how to finance these


activities.


c.           Pick enterprises that he believes to be worth investing in and then loan


them the money they need to operate.


d.           None of the above.


 


Answer: c


Explanation: None needed, as it is a definitional truth.

      Question 1


      Which of the following statements is true?


            a.           People work more efficiently if they try to do everything


      themselves.


            b.           People should be forcibly restrained from working too


      hard since independent work is inefficient and psychologically


      unhealthy.


            c.           People should not be allowed to change jobs or modes of


      employment since it leads to confusion and poverty.


            d.           A rigid and inflexible labor market is not likely to be as


      efficient as a flexible and adaptive labor market.


 


      Answer: d

      order to manufacture equipment or other tangibles.


            b.           A financier is someone who loans capital to others in order


    to help launch or sustain economic enterprises.


            c.           Both of the above. 


            d.           None of the above.


 


      Answer: b

launch or run businesses.


 


      Question 5


      True or false? The disciplines of finance and economics are identical.            a.           True


            b.           False


 


      Answer: b


      Explanation: Economics studies the creation and distribution of wealth;


finance studies how to identify and capitalize investment-grade businesses.


 


 


      Question 6


      Which of the following statements is true?


            a.           In an efficient economy, nothing is created that isn't


      immediately consumed.


            b.           In an efficient economy, surpluses are created but not used


    to eliminate shortages.


            c.           An efficient economy, surpluses are created and then used


    to eliminate shortages.


            d.           All of the above


            e.           None of the above


 


      Answer: c


      Explanation: An efficient economy creates more than it needs butpromptly reinvests excesses, instead of letting idle.


 


      Question 7


      True or false? As a general rule, rigid labor markets lead to innovation


and prosperity


            a.           True


            b.           False


 


      Answer:  b


      Explanation: Rigid labor markets are the kiss of macroeconomic death.


      Discussion: Sometimes rigid labor markets are a consequence of too


much government, and sometimes they are consequence of too little


government. So the relevant question is ‘how much freedom is there?’, not


‘how much freedom from government is there?’
