kuczynski | Some knowledge is direct; some is indirect. Indirect knowledge is knowledge that is acquired through inference. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | To make an inference is to form a new belief on the basis of an old one. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Inferences, when legitimate, are made in accordance with legitimate rules of inference. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Rules of inference, when legitimate, correspond to dependence-relations. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | There are two kinds of dependence-relations: logical and causal. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Logical dependence-relations hold among propositions. A proposition is a truth or a falsehood. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | The proposition that x is a triangle cannot be true unless the proposition that x has three sides is true. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Causal relations hold among states of affairs, not truths and falsehoods. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | The objects of knowledge are propositions. It isn't known unless it's believed and it isn't believed unless it's a proposition. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | One can be aware of non-propositions, e.g. rocks, trees, people, but one does not in the relevant sense know them. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Some dependence-relations are known, not through sensory observation, but through conceptual analysis. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Analytic knowledge is always knowledge of dependence-relations. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Knowledge is conceptually articulated awareness. In order for me to know that my shoes are uncomfortably tight, I need to have the concepts shoe, tight, discomfort, etc. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | I do not need to have these concepts---or, arguably, any concepts---to be aware of the uncomfortable tightness in my shoes. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | There are two kinds of awareness: propositional and objectual. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Observations are objectual awarenesses. The contents of such awarenesses must be converted into propositions if they are to be explained. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Causal relations can be known only through one s senses (through sight, touch, etc.) and through real-time awareness of one s own psychological processes. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Theoretical truths are necessarily known through inference, and knowledge of such truths is therefore inferential. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | But not all inferential knowledge is theoretical knowledge. I notice that you look tired and on that basis know that you didn't get enough sleep. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | A theory is given by a proposition that, if true, describes some relatively comprehensive fact about the structure of the universe. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | If you know it, then (i) You believe it, (ii) It is true, and (iii) Your reasons for believing it are legitimate. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | At the same time, given only that it's true and that you are justified in believing it, it doesn't follow that you know it. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Causal necessity is different from logical necessity. Given that x is a triangle, it is logically necessary that x have three sides. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | One state of affairs e is evidence of another state of affairs e* iff (if and only if) e and e* are causally related in such a way that, if one knows of e s existence, one has reason to believe in e* existence. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | All information is evidence, but not all evidence is information. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Our sense-perceptions are isomorphs of the objects they represent: the latter transmit their structures to the former. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | It is only to the extent that our beliefs are linked by information-transmissive series to the corresponding realities that those beliefs are knowledge. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | For one event e to precede another event e* is for there to be a possible causal process beginning with e and ending with e*. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Effects are continuations of their causes. An event transmits information about its cause to the extent that the former inherits its structure from the latter. | Inferential Knowledge and Logical Dependence
kuczynski | Given that you are human, it can be inferred that you will fall ill if you consume cyanide, but not that you will go into anaphylactic shock if you eat shellfish. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Consequently, (a) x is human?x is cyanide-intolerant is a legitimate rule of inference, whereas (b) x is human?x is shellfish-intolerant is not a legitimate rule of inference. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Each of (a) and (c) supports predictions and counterfactuals; (b) does not do so, and neither does an accidental, albeit place- and time-invariant, generalization. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | The difference between (a) and (c) is one of degree: (a) is more approximate than (c) and (a) also has less scope than (c). | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | In order to discover the structure of the world, we must organize the data at our disposal; and in order to organize the data at our disposal, we need to use principles, such as (a), that are of limited scope and are only approximately true. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | With every increase in our knowledge, there is a change in what there is to know about the world, given that any given instance of knowledge is no less a constituent of the world than is a rock or a chair. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Therefore, attempts to plug up the holes in our knowledge of the world create new such holes, it being the purpose of science, not to eliminate such holes, but to minimize their number and to restrict the scope of those cannot be eliminated. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | It is inherent in what it is to be physiologically human (or otherwise mammalian) that a human being be cyanide intolerant. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Laws of nature are not perfect concomitances: for it to be a law of nature that instances of phi bring about instances of psi is not for each and every phi to be followed by an instance of psi. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | For there to be such a law is for instances of phi to be dispositive, for reasons of a relatively non-context-specific nature, of the occurrence of instances of psi. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | If x causes y, then x and y are events. They are not rocks, trees, or snowmen. They are not things, in other words, at least not in the sense in which we will use that word. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Conditions, e.g. Smith’s having high blood pressure, can be causes and effects. This is because conditions are event-pluralities and therefore events in their own right. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Scientific knowledge enables us to explain past events and to predict future ones, and it thereby enables us, within limits, to control the course of events. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | In contexts in which there are stable patterns of events, it tends to be possible to explain, predict, and control what happens; and it tends to be impossible to do so in contexts in which there are no such patterns and which therefore consist of rogue events. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Given some event En, En’s program-cause is a structure or stable condition that, although not by itself determinative of En, predetermines the occurrence of some structure-internal specific event En-1 that is thus determinative. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Freud correctly says that, if a given person X succumbs to a given psychology malady M, four different kinds of causes are likely to be operative. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | When Freud says that a given psychological event e is overdetermined, he means that it was brought about by the confluence of two or more psychological events each of which justified e’s occurrence. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Thus, if Freud was right, as he surely was, causation in the psychological sphere often involves the exceeding of thresholds: it isn’t enough that x have just one reason for falling in love with y; unless he has several reasons, nothing happens. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Discontinuous changes tend to involve threshold effects. A circuit breaker doesn’t do anything until there is electricity-overload, at which point it shuts off the electrical pathway in question. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | It follows that e was an insufficient but non-redundant part of a condition that unnecessary but sufficient for e*’s occurrence that, in other words, that e was an INUS condition for e*. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Thus, many counterfactuals are to the effect that one thing caused another to happen and many counterfactuals therefore hold in virtue of dependence-relations of the causal variety. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | This means that counterfactuals hold in virtue of the logical and causal structure of our world, as opposed to other worlds. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | Given that the cause of an event is what guarantees its occurrence, the boiling of the water is, insofar as it guaranteed the occurrence of the likes of c1 cn, appropriately described as the cause of the cracking of the vessel. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | In general, where there is causal redundancy, causal truths cannot be converted into counterfactual truths. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | According to CAC, the meaning of (#) e is the cause of e* is (#*) If e hadn’t happened, then e* wouldn’t have happened. | Deduction, Induction, and Scientific Knowledge
kuczynski | In general, supposing that e is the cause of e*, it is only if e is insufficiently described that if e hadn't happened, then e* wouldn't have happened fails to be a consequence of e is the cause of e*. | Causation
kuczynski | Had I not done so, someone else might have pushed the button at t and the elevator would still have come, and the result would have been the same: the elevator would have come at the same time, in the same way. | Causation
kuczynski | Thus, had some other person pushed the button, the result would have been the very same event that resulted from my pushing the button. | Causation
kuczynski | Therefore CACD is false, given that, according to it, the (hypothetical) event resulting from the other person s pushing the button would not have been numerically identical with the (actual) event resulting from my pushing it. | Causation
kuczynski | In general, the identity of a given threshold effect is not contingent on the specific composition of its antecedents. | Causation
kuczynski | Thus, where threshold effects are concerned, there is genuine causal redundancy, and CACD is therefore false. | Causation
kuczynski | But if I hadn't hit ENTER, the 3 still would have appeared, since my friend Gus would have hit ENTER had I not done so. | Causation
kuczynski | In general, the identity an event that can be implemented in different ways isn't contingent on its exact composition or, therefore, on the exact composition of its cause. | Causation
kuczynski | Thus, where such events are concerned, there is genuine causal redundancy, and CACD is therefore false. | Causation
kuczynski | Therefore, if m1 mn hadn't occurred, the conversion-process still would have occurred, thanks to some entirely distinct confluence of micro-events m*1 m*m. | Causation
kuczynski | In general, the identity of an event whose cause programs for it is not contingent on its specific composition or on the precise identity of its immediate antecedents. | Causation
kuczynski | According to CAC, e is the cause of e* iff e* wouldn't have happened had e not happened. | Causation
kuczynski | My pushing the button is the cause of the elevator s coming, but the elevator might have come even if I hadn't pushed the button somebody else might have pushed it. | Causation
kuczynski | Therefore, CAC is false. Attempts to falsify Frankfurt s critique are false. Therefore CAC is demonstrably false, and not merely prima facie so. | Causation
kuczynski | According to Hume, e1 is the direct cause of e2 iff any event that is similar to e1 spatially adjacent to an immediately posterior event that is similar to e2. | Causation
kuczynski | Hume therefore holds that laws are regularities and causal sequences are instances of such regularities. | Causation
kuczynski | Hume therefore rejects the conventional view, according to which laws are structures that are responsible for such regularities and are therefore distinct from them. | Causation
kuczynski | Hume therefore rejects the conventional view, according to which causes are responsible for their effects and are therefore not merely their antecedents. | Causation
kuczynski | If there is any empirical (observational) basis for saying that e caused e*, it is the fact that e was e* s immediate predecessor and neighbor, coupled with the fact that events similar to e are always the immediate predecessors and neighbors of events similar to e*. | Causation
kuczynski | It is presumed that e compelled e* to occur and that its doing so involved more than its immediately preceding and being adjacent to e*. But no such compulsion was observed. | Causation
kuczynski | There are two kinds of causal processes: (i) Those that involve interactions and (ii) Those that consist solely of instances of persistence. | Causation
kuczynski | Following Bertrand Russell, we will refer to type-(i) causation as transeunt causation and to type-(ii) causation as immanent causation. | Causation
kuczynski | The difference between immanent and transeunt causation is that immanent causation is, whereas transeunt causation is not, structure-preserving. | Causation
kuczynski | Any given case of transeunt causation involves the cessation of a structure-preserving causal series. | Causation
kuczynski | The essence of transeunt causation is the discontinuous alteration of object-constitutive causal-series. | Causation
kuczynski | The essence of transeunt causation is discontinuity. The essence of immanent causation is continuity. | Causation
kuczynski | Hume takes it for granted that all instances of causation are identical with such disruptions, and Hume therefore takes it for granted that those continuities per se are non-causal. | Causation
kuczynski | Because Hume took breakdowns of causal cohesiveness as instances of such cohesiveness, he believed causation to be a relation between disjoint entities. | Causation
kuczynski | Given that the actual and the hypothetical situations are observationally indistinguishable, it follows that no causal nexus linking cause and effect can be observed in the actual situation. | Causation
kuczynski | In general, genuine causal processes are observationally distinguishable from pseudo-causal processes. | Causation
kuczynski | These points suggest that the essence of causation is continuity: a continuous event-series is a causal process; a discontinuous event-series is a non-causal process. | Causation
kuczynski | The temporal order is to be understood in terms of the causal order, not vice versa. Hume's analysis assumes otherwise and is therefore viciously circular and therefore false. | Causation
kuczynski | Correlation is not causation. A consequence of Hume s analysis---indeed, the very essence of it---is that correlation is causation. Therefore, Hume s analysis is false. | Causation
kuczynski | Hume s analysis therefore entails that any two spatiotemporally adjacent events are related as cause and effect. Since this isn t the case, Hume s analysis is incorrect. | Causation
kuczynski | if x has phi, then x has psi is a law, then we must know that, given some arbitrary instance A of phi, A s being a phi is what is responsible for A s being a psi. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | it follows that explanations are not, at least not in general, law-based and, more precisely, that they do not, at least not in general, have the form to explain E is to identify known laws L1 Ln such that, if C1 Cm is a description of the antecedents of E, then E is a logical consequence of L1 Ln+C1 Cm. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | According to Hempel, if we want to know that the rope snapped, we need to know (i) What the conditions were that obtained prior to the rope s snapping, and (ii) What the natural laws were in virtue of which those conditions led to the rope s snapping. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | If C is one of E s preconditions, C is a relevant precondition only if C caused E. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | Thus, in order to provide a deductive-nomological explanation of E, we must already have an explanation of E. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | For me to know why Smith is sick it is not enough for me to know what made him sick (he ate rotten fish); I also need to know how his eating rotten fish led to his being ill. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | if I know what led to the rope s snapping (it was made of bubble gum and there was a heavy ball attached to it), I am surely aware of a correct explanation of the rope-snapping. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | a precondition for our knowing of such a law seems to be that we know of individual cases of metal expanding in consequence of being heated. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | If our only reason for thinking that x expands when heated is that x does expand when heated, then in positing a law to the effect that they are causally connected, all we are doing is saying: 'It is so; for it must be so.' | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | Threshold effects aside, effects are proportional to their causes. This has several consequences, none of them consistent with RA or with DN. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | First of all, laws are not expressed by regularities. A collision may or may not displace an object. It may be destroy it. It may not destroy it, but may fail to make it budge. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | to the extent that laws are expressed by regularities, they are expressed by regularities of proportion: volume increases directly proportional to temperature increases; gravitational attraction is proportional to the masses of the bodies in question. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | Given that we can know what causes a given event without knowing of any law L that links cause and effect, it follows, given that to explain an event is to identify its cause, that we can sometimes explain events without explaining them in terms of laws. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | To explain an event in detail is to explain how the specifics of the event depended on the specifics of the cause, and for that we do need laws. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | We must distinguish between non-explanations and pre-scientific explanations. Non-explanations are not pre-scientific explanations. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | If my explanation of the fact that I burnt my hand is that I touched a hot surface, my explanation is correct, but not scientific. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | According to Hume, we know that e causes e* because (i) e immediately precedes, and is adjacent with, e*, and (ii) e-similar events always immediately precede adjacent e*-similar events. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | Thus, if we know that e is the cause of e*, it isn’t necessarily because we have observed some regularity of which that event-sequence (e followed by e*) is an instance. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | It may be that, unless one has knowledge of laws, one cannot know why a given event followed some other event. But without knowledge of laws one can obviously know that the first event was indeed the cause of the second. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | To know what caused an event is to know how to explain it. I can explain your tantrum: I insulted you. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | This shows that, contrary to what DN assumes, not all explanations are law-based. In some cases we know that e causes e*, and we are therefore know a (low-resolution but otherwise) correct explanation of the latter, even though we don’t know of any law that connects the two events. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | One quite glaring failure of DN concerns its treatment of psychological explanations. If DN is right, as Hempel makes clear, not a single one of the psychological explanations ever put forth identifies the cause of any psychological event. | The Regularity Analysis of Causation
kuczynski | DN entails that, unless you know of some regularity of which your writing this fugue is an instance, you cannot possibly know that your doing so is a consequence of your being dumped. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | DN also entails that, unless people who are dumped always respond by trying to impress their exes, no person s attempting to rekindle his/her ex s affections through a heroic deed is a consequence of him/her being dumped by said ex---which is false. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | Hempel acknowledges that perfect regularities often are not available. And he says that, in such cases, one must rely on imperfect regularities: regularities of the form e-similar events usually precede e*-similar events. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | The probability that an insult will elicit a tantrum is small: most insults do not result in tantrums. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | In general, supposing that most phi s are followed by psi s, it doesn t follow that phi s cause psi s, even part of the time, or a fortiori that there is a statistical law to the effect that n% of phi s cause (or are followed by) phi s (for some n>50). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | Smoking causes emphysema; but only emphysema occurs in less than 30% of people who smoke the requisite amount (the amount the emphysemics smoked, at least before they got emphysema). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | Wesley Salmon introduced the statistical relevance model, as an alternative to DN. But the statistical relevance model, being nothing more than a watered down version of the Deductive nomological model, has the latter s defects but not its virtues. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | DN doesn t hold with respect to all explanations; it isn t possible to give deductive nomological explanations of events until it is known what is causally relevant. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | So far as DN is correct, it s a correct description of scientific explanation, a scientific explanation of E being one that says both (i) What made E happen and (ii) How it did so. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | As a matter of logic, sentences that are logically equivalent must be confirmationally equivalent, but there are logically equivalent sentences that are not confirmationally equivalent (e.g. all ravens are black and all non-black things are non-ravens). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | The Raven Paradox: Consider: R1: All ravens are black (if x is a raven, then x is black), and R2: All non-black things are non-ravens (if x is non-black, then x isn t a raven). R1 and R2 are equivalent. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | R3: x is a pink piano. R3 confirms R2, but not R1. The pinkness of pianos has nothing to do with the blackness of ravens. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | Hempel s solution R3 does confirm R1 and R2 equally. We think otherwise because, our background beliefs being what they are, we believe it impossible that pianos should be ravens. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | The problem with Hempel s solution We can t learn anything about ravens by studying pianos. We can t learn anything about metal by studying meat. Hempel s solution implies otherwise and is therefore false. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | For Hempel, as for Hume, there are no causal connections, only regularities that mimic causal connections. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | The problem of induction What is the problem of induction? P: The sun has always risen. Q: It will rise tomorrow. U (The Uniformity Principle): Nature is uniform. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | P doesn t entail Q. So it is only to the extent that P confirms Q that P provides any support for Q. And it is only to the extent that U is the true that P confirms Q. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | We must distinguish induction by enumeration (also known as enumerative induction (EI)) from inference to the best explanation (IBE). | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | Enumerative induction (EI) defined: Every known phi has also been a psi. Therefore, unknown phi s are also psi s. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | Inference to the best explanation (IBE) defined: Let d1 dn be the data at our disposal. Suppose that, if d1 dn were all there was to know about the world, then the world would contain many anomalies, i.e. many unexplained phenomena. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | In general, an IBE is a hypothesis to the effect that some hitherto unknown entity X exists such that, if X does indeed exist, then some hitherto anomalous phenomenon ceases to be anomalous. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | Unless coupled with acceptance of an IBE, one s knowledge that past phi s have been psi s doesn t legitimate his believing that unknown phi s are also psi s. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | Whenever someone seems to infer (a) All phi s are psi s from (b) All known phi s are psi s, that person is really inferring (a) from (b) coupled with some IBE. | Shortcomings of the Deductive-Nomological Model
kuczynski | This means that, if we know e and e* to belong to the same space-time manifold, then we know there to be some causal connection between them; we know that either (i) e causes e*; (ii) e* causes e; or (iii) some third event e# causes, or is caused by, both. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | If observation does not apprise us of such a connection, we do have to posit hidden continuities, since the non-existence of such continuities is incompatible with the datum that e and e* are part of the same space-time manifold. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Because we observed each and were therefore affected by each. Since causally connected events are ipso facto co-occupants of some one space-time manifold, e and e* are such co-occupants. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | This means that to validate the datum that two events, e and e*, are part of the same space-time manifold, it is necessary to posit unobserved events that link those two events. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Herein lies the justification for positing unobserved continuities to explain observed events in terms of other observed events. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Given only that there is a causal connection of some kind between any two co-occupants of some single manifold, how does it follow that the causal connections between past (known) events will bear any resemblance to future (or otherwise unknown) events? | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | A universe of rogue events, none causative of the other, isn’t a universe at all. To the extent that events are causally independent of each other, there is no sense in which they co-occupy some single manifold. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Hume’s attempt to delegitimize induction presupposes that the laws of physics can just be suspended. That presupposition in its turn assumes that the laws of physics are separable from the space-time manifold; it assumes, in other words, that they are not constitutive of that manifold. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Laws are not independent of one another. In actuality, gas-pressure is directly proportional to temperature. If it were inversely proportional to temperature, every one of the laws of mechanics would have to be jettisoned or heavily modified. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | This means that, if the laws of physics changed at time t*, the result would be the obliteration of the space-time manifold---the universe---in which those laws were operative. Different laws, different spatiotemporal manifold. Different spatiotemporal manifold, different universe. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | The space-time manifold isn’t an empty vessel that can house different laws; it is defined by the laws that govern its occupants. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | We know that U is true because, if it weren’t, nothing would persist---literally---including the very entities that make inductive inferences. U is a precondition for the making of inductive inferences. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Objects are constituted by the forces that govern them; those forces are instances of physical laws. Different laws, different forces; different forces, different objects. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Thus, if U1 is the universe before t and U2 is the universe after t, no occupant of U1 would exist in U2. None of the laws that hold that object together would be operative. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | This means that if there are physical laws, then, until time comes to an end, our inductive practices have a legitimate basis. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Many inductive inferences do not concern the future; they concern what is present or past but is unknown. If I inductively infer that, at this exact time, some object is still solid, that inference doesn’t concern the future. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Determinism: The doctrine that how the world is at any point in time fixes how it will be at all later times. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | Indeterminism: The doctrine that determinism is false. Equivalently, the doctrine that there is some point in time t such that, for some later time t*, how the world is at fails to determine how the world is, in every respect, at t*. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | The world is deterministic to the extent that it is law-governed. Supposing that the state of the universe at t determines the state of the universe at later time t*, that is because there are laws of nature L1 Ln such that, given the state of the universe at t, there is exactly one way the universe can be at t*. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | If there are no laws, and thus no deterministic mechanisms, that link the present to the future, then the future is ipso facto open, i.e. there are many ways it can be, and predictions cannot be made. | The Problem of Induction
kuczynski | In order to learn about the subatomic world, one must irradiate it, i.e. flood it with light or otherwise bombard it with radiation of some kind or another. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | The effect of flooding the microphysical world with light is to change it utterly. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | There is no conceivable being that could have complete knowledge of the microstructure of the world. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Therefore, nothing could have complete knowledge of the conditions obtaining at t, for any time t, or, consequently, at any later time t*. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Knowledge of the future= Knowledge of initial conditions+knowledge of laws+ The knowledge yielded by making the inferences warranted by the first two kinds of knowledge. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Given that two facts that do fall within the scope of science entail that there are things about the world that cannot be known, it follows that, for science no less than for metaphysics, the world is to some extent unknowable. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | No creature can possibly predict what it will come to know. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Given that what you know affects what you do, and thus affects how the world is, it follows that no creature can know exactly what it will do or, therefore, exactly how what it will do will affect the world. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | If x and y are identical in respect of their microphysical properties, then it is inconceivable that they should differ in respect of their biological properties. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | In general, one class of facts supervenes on another class of facts exactly if there can t be a change in the former without there being a change in the latter but not vice versa. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | It is said that the mental supervenes on the physiological: given two creatures that are physiologically identical, it is impossible that they should differ psychologically. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Nothing can violate the laws of physics. There are no mass-energy displacements that are not governed by the laws of physics. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | The laws of physics don t say anything about computation, storage space, etc. Those concepts (computation, etc.) don t exist as far as those laws are concerned. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | So a physics-omniscient being does not in virtue of that fact have any computer-specific concepts and therefore does not have any computer-related knowledge. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | To the extent that x is a computer---to the extent that x is something that implements a program---x is a deterministic system. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Supposing that the laws of physics are indeterministic, it doesn t follow that higher-order laws are indeterministic. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Statistics are evidence of probabilities; statistics are not themselves probabilities. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Also, statistics are only as truth-conducive as they are consistent with the causal mechanisms that generate them. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | When it is said that that probability of a computer-malfunction is greater than 0%, the statement being made is to be interpreted causally, not statistically. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | What is being said is that, the laws of physics being what they are and the construction of the computer being what it is, it is a possibility, albeit one that may never be actualized, that brand-new/well-constructed/etc. computers malfunction. | Determinism and Natural Laws
kuczynski | Two objects have the same length if they are length-congruent. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Absent a definition of congruence, L is longer than L* and L and L* are length-identical are devoid of meaning. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Absent a definition of length-congruence, no object L can be a length-standard. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | A given object is provisionally taken as a length-standard. A congruence-relation is defined. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Small distances can be measured using meter rods, and they can also be measured using light rays. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Large distances can be measured using light rays, but they cannot be measured using meter-rods. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Within narrow horizons, meter-rod measurements and optical measurements yield the same results. This is a contingent fact. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | One cannot use a thermometer to measure the temperature of magma, let alone the temperature of a star. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Day-to-day experience gives us approximate metrical knowledge, on the basis of which we can identify correlations. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Non-simultaneous events cannot be laid side by side. If it is to be known how two such events compare in respect of duration, one must know of some periodic process. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Conventionalism is false. This will be discussed below. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | If duration is measured in terms of a process that is intuitively known to be erratic, the resulting measurements aren’t consistent with one another. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Length and mass are extensive magnitudes. Temperature is an intensive magnitude. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | An extensive magnitude is one such that the degree to which a given object has that magnitude exceeds the degree to any given one of its parts has that magnitude. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | A consequence---actually, the very essence of Special Relativity---is that there is no optical test by means of which one determine whether or not one is moving. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | If speed were additive, these statements would be counterlogical. But speed, though extensive, is not additive. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | If a given object’s length is given by an irrational number, that object’s length cannot be established by measuring that object. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | According to many (e.g. Russell, Poincaré, Einstein), this entails that, in taking LS to be length-constant, we are simply adopting a convention, not registering a fact. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Since it is entirely a matter of convention whether a given object is such a standard, the laws of nature are determined by our conventions. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Supposing arguendo that conventionalism is correct, it doesn’t follow that the laws of nature are entirely a matter of convention. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | Strict conventionalism isn’t a form of conventionalism. In fact, the two doctrines are incompatible. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | The results of measurements are not determined by our metrical conventions. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | A system of measurement must yield consistent results: if, relative to a given metrical standard, a given object both has, and does not have, a given length n, then that standard cannot coherently be used. | Measurement and Conventionalism
kuczynski | It is an empirical fact that, when objects that we intuitively regard as length-variable are used as length-standards, the resulting measurements are inconsistent with one another. | Measurement and Conventionalism
