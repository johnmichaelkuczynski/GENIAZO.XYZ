3 KUCZYNSKI POSITION STATEMENTS

50 POSITIONS FROM "UNIQUELY INDIVIDUATING DESCRIPTIONS"


ON THE CENTRAL THESIS

1. In order to refer to an object, one must know of some description that singles it out—a uniquely individuating description (UID).

2. In order to think about an object, one must know of some description that singles it out.

3. Without knowledge of a uniquely individuating description, there is no reference and there is no conception.

4. Causal connections to objects, though essential, have a subordinate role: they facilitate conception and reference by being part of one's knowledge of a uniquely individuating description.

5. The ability to think about Socrates requires knowledge of a description that singles him out, even though "Socrates" itself has no descriptive content.


ON KRIPKE AND DIRECT REFERENCE

6. Kripke's major point about proper names is correct: "Socrates" is not a disguised definite description.

7. Direct reference theory is correct—the sole semantic value of "Socrates" is Socrates.

8. Semantics is not epistemology: given that "Socrates" is a label rather than a description, it does not follow that one can think about Socrates without knowing a UID.

9. None of Kripke's important semantic insights require abandoning the position that thinking about x requires knowing a description that applies uniquely to x.

10. Kripke's own account actually requires that one always have knowledge of a uniquely individuating description.


ON RUSSELL'S THEORY

11. According to Russell, "Socrates" is synonymous with a definite description—Kripke demolished this view.

12. One can understand sentences containing "Socrates" without knowing any particular description that uniquely applies to him.

13. Given any description D that applies uniquely to Socrates, one can understand "Socrates was wise" without knowing that D applies to Socrates.


ON CAUSAL THEORIES OF REFERENCE

14. "Socrates" refers to Socrates because a certain kind of causal relation holds between tokens of "Socrates" and Socrates himself.

15. Reference is transmitted through a chain of causal connections from original acquaintance through successive speakers.

16. Words undergo phonetic distortion as they are transmitted through causal chains, but the principles governing appropriation remain the same.


ON WAYS OF LEARNING WHAT A TERM REFERS TO

17. There are three ways to add a referring term to one's lexicon: ostensive definition, descriptive definition, or simply "picking up" the use.

18. Ostensive definition actually collapses into a kind of descriptive definition.

19. In most cases where we seem to appropriate a name through descriptive definition, we are actually appropriating it through "picking up."

20. Cases of genuinely acquiring a name through pure descriptive definition are rare and tend to be artificial.


ON OSTENSIVE DEFINITION

21. For an ostensive definition to work, one must have some way of singling out the object being pointed to.

22. Picking out a single object involves knowing a uniquely individuating description.

23. Even when thirty qualitatively identical people are present, ostension works because one knows "there is some x such that the speaker just pointed x out."

24. The description from ostension need not tell you anything about how the referent differs psychologically or physically from others—it need only enable cognitive singling out.

25. The causal connection in seeing someone is a component of one's knowledge of a uniquely individuating description, not primary in itself.


ON "PICKING UP" NAMES

26. One can acquire ability to use a name meaningfully just by overhearing others use it, without ostensive or descriptive definition.

27. When you overhear Smith say "Argo is a cad," you thereby know: on that occasion, there was exactly one person Smith was describing as a cad, and "Argo" refers to that person.

28. Terms like "occasion" and "context" are context-sensitive—an occasion can be a millisecond or an entire era.

29. Within any conversation where multiple names are used, there are sub-occasions where each name refers to exactly one person being described.

30. The information you have about the context of a speech act—even if the speech act's content is minimal—gives you a uniquely individuating description.


ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLAIMS

31. "Exactly one person has phi" differs from "Exactly one person is being described, on some occasion, as having phi."

32. Your picking up "Argo" doesn't require learning that exactly one person is a cad—only that on a specific occasion exactly one person was being described as a cad.

33. The information enabling reference comes not just from what the speaker says but from your perception of the conversational context.


ON TRANSMISSION THROUGH CAUSAL CHAINS

34. If you are at five hundred removes from someone acquainted with the referent, the same principles of appropriation apply.

35. However distorted a word becomes through phonetic transmission, appropriating it still requires knowledge of a uniquely individuating description.

36. There is no vicious circularity: the original namer learned through ostension, and each subsequent appropriator learns through knowledge of a UID.


ON REPLACEMENT OF DESCRIPTIONS

37. One typically forgets the existence-claim through which one originally added a name to one's lexicon.

38. The original uniquely individuating description is not simply dropped—it is replaced by another "interlocking" description.

39. The new description "inherits" the verifier of the old one: the thing making both true is the same.

40. This process of replacement continues indefinitely—e3 replaces e2, which replaced e1, and so on.

41. So long as one is able to think about someone, one possesses some uniquely individuating description of them.


ON THE ABILITY TO REFER WITHOUT KNOWING WHO

42. One can be able to think about and refer to someone without knowing who they are in any historically significant sense.

43. Most "descriptive definitions" are really cases of learning who somebody is, not cases of acquiring the ability to refer to them.

44. The ability to refer to and think about an object usually pre-exists learning who or what that object is.


ON LITERAL MEANING VS. COGNITIVE CONTENT

45. One must distinguish literal meaning from cognitive content.

46. The literal meaning of "Fred looked puffy" is simply: Fred looked puffy—not some existential-descriptive claim.

47. Even though names are just labels semantically, one learns which thing a name labels through existential-descriptive claims.

48. The semantics of a name are not existential-descriptive, but the act of learning those semantics is existential-descriptive.


ON SCOPE AND OPERATORS

49. When giving descriptive definitions, the descriptive information must be given wide-scope relative to the "means that" operator—otherwise the definition is false.

50. The operator "the semantic rule for __ is" must be given narrow-scope to avoid commitment to false descriptivism.

POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM: The Will to Project
Cults, Hyperreality, and the Foundations of Religion
==================================================

NATURE OF CULTS VS. RELIGIONS
-----------------------------
1. A religion is a sanitized, rationalized cult that has become respectable and absorbed into society.
2. A religion is a cult that has been institutionalized and bureaucratized into near-lifelessness.
3. Religions are degenerate cults, not the reverse—degenerate precisely because they conform to rationality-based benchmarks.
4. Religions lack the "spiritual vitality" that sets them apart from ordinary institutions like the Department of Motor Vehicles.
5. A cult is a case of collective person-worship.
6. Worship by a single individual does not constitute a cult; the collective element is essential.
7. Multiple individuals worshipping the same person independently (without mutual policing) does not constitute a cult.
8. A cult exists when followers police each other to perpetuate the cycle of worship.

NATURE OF WORSHIP
-----------------
9. Worshipping something is not the same as acknowledging that it has great power.
10. Being worshipful of a thing is not equivalent to making due allowances for its strengths.
11. Worshipping someone may entail believing they possess some virtue to an extreme degree, but the entailment does not go in the reverse direction.
12. Believing someone is superhumanly capable does not necessarily entail worshipping them.
13. Superhuman is not the same as supernatural.
14. To worship x is to regard x as supernatural.
15. One's high regard for a worshipped entity is not answerable to empirical data.
16. What is worshipped is necessarily a fiction.
17. What is worshipped is necessarily a projection.

PROJECTION AND REALITY
----------------------
18. Projection is unconscious assignment of a role or significance to something.
19. "Unconscious projection" is a pleonasm, since projection is by definition unconscious role-assignment.
20. Projection is equivalent to virtualization—experiencing what is internal as external.
21. We can unconsciously assign people roles just as we can consciously do so in LARPing.
22. When you consciously assign someone a fictional role, you retain awareness that they are not actually that character.
23. When you unconsciously project a role onto someone, you genuinely experience the fictional character through them.
24. A projected being appears as an apparition inhabiting a world it is not truly of.

EVALUATION UNDER PROJECTION
---------------------------
25. When evaluating a non-projected person, their behavior is assessed on its own terms relative to evidence.
26. When evaluating a projected person, their behavior is assessed with respect to their ability to function as a proxy for the projected fiction.
27. Measures will be taken to compatibilize contradictory evidence with the projected fiction (e.g., explaining stupidity as a ploy or drug influence).
28. If someone continually fails to match the projected fiction, they may be "fired" from that role.
29. The answer to "what does X tell us about person P?" necessarily differs from "what does X tell us about P's feasibility as a fiction-proxy?"

THE SUPERNATURAL
----------------
30. A projected being is ipso facto supernatural.
31. A hallucinated entity (pure projection) can violate physical laws—walk on water, fly, walk through walls.
32. A projection onto an actual person is more constrained by physical reality but is still supernatural.
33. Projections onto real persons allow for supernatural interpretation of ambiguous perceptual data.
34. Perceptual data is disambiguated in favor of supernatural interpretation when the subject is a projection-target.
35. "Supernatural" means not merely "not bound by natural law" but "such that it is not even to be understood in terms of natural law."
36. A supernatural being is one that is "in this world but not of it."
37. Alleged singularities or anomalies are still of this world and are therefore not supernatural.
38. To say something is "of another world" is to say its true home is a fictitious universe making an appearance in reality.
39. Supposedly supernatural beings are always emotionally significant.
40. If x is projected, then x is supernatural.
41. If x is supernatural, then x is projected.
42. A supernatural being is a fiction that we are seeing in something real.

THE DIVINE AS A SPECIES OF THE SUPERNATURAL
-------------------------------------------
43. "Divine" is a subcategory of "supernatural"—all divine beings are supernatural.
44. Not all supernatural beings are divine (e.g., monsters like Michael Myers are supernatural but not divine).
45. Even debased supernatural beings (like movie monsters) are not merely non-divine but anti-divine—divine in the manner of representatives of Satan.
46. Divine beings and supernatural beings are ultimately cut from the same cloth.

THE CULT LEADER
---------------
47. The cult leader is necessarily perceived as supernatural, not merely as competent or virtuous.
48. Extraordinary natural ability (e.g., Mozartian talent) is not sufficient for cult leadership on its own.
49. Natural abilities can serve as evidence of supernatural status but do not qualify someone for cult leadership on their own terms.
50. The cult leader must be the object of projection; followers are not following him but following the fiction of which he has been made the personification.
