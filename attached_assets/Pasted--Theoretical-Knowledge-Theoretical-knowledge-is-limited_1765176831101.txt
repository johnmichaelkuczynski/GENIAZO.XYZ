### Theoretical Knowledge
- Theoretical knowledge is limited to what can be derived from sensory impressions and ideas, rejecting speculative metaphysics as unintelligible.
- It is divided into "relations of ideas" (a priori, certain, like mathematics) and "matters of fact" (probabilistic, empirical).
- All ideas must trace back to impressions via the Copy Principle; anything beyond experience lacks content.
- Knowledge is provisional and based on the science of human nature, not ultimate realities.
- Custom and habit, rather than reason, extend knowledge beyond immediate perceptions.

### Causal Knowledge (Knowledge of Causal Ties)
- Causal ties are not observed directly; we only see constant conjunctions, not necessary connections.
- The idea of causation arises from the mind's habitual transition after repeated observations.
- Reason cannot demonstrate causal connections a priori or through probable reasoning without circularity.
- Causal knowledge is probabilistic, based on custom and association, not inherent powers in objects.
- Inferences to unseen causes (e.g., origins of the universe) are weak analogies, limited by experience.

### Inferential Knowledge
- Inferential knowledge pertains to matters of fact and is probable, not demonstrative.
- It relies on the assumption of nature's uniformity, which arises from custom, not reason.
- Belief in inferences is a lively idea produced by associative habits, akin to instinct.
- Inductive inferences cannot be justified rationally without assuming what they seek to prove.
- In religious contexts, inferences like the design argument are underdetermined and lead to skepticism.

### Analytic Knowledge (Knowledge of Analytic Truths)
- Analytic truths are relations of ideas, known a priori through intuition or demonstration, without depending on existence.
- They are certain; their denial implies contradiction (e.g., mathematical propositions).
- Such knowledge is limited to abstract relations and does not apply to causal or factual matters.
- Analytic truths provide no information about the world beyond conceptual analysis.
- Attempts to extend them to infinite attributes (e.g., God's) render them meaningless.

### Non-Analytic Knowledge
- Non-analytic knowledge concerns matters of fact, known probabilistically through experience.
- Contraries are conceivable without contradiction, unlike analytic truths.
- It depends on causal reasoning, which is grounded in habit rather than reason.
- Such knowledge cannot reveal necessary truths and is always open to doubt.
- In moral or religious claims, it fails when evidence (e.g., evil) contradicts assumptions like divine benevolence.

### Knowledge of Self
- Self-knowledge is empirical, derived from impressions of reflection like passions and desires.
- It is more vivid than external knowledge but still limited to perceptions.
- Introspection reveals no foundational certainty beyond current impressions.
- Sympathy allows extension of self-knowledge to others' mental states via association.
- Reason plays a passive role; passions dominate self-understanding.

### The Nature of the Self
- The self is not a unified, persistent substance but a bundle or collection of perceptions.
- There is no distinct impression of a simple self; identity arises from memory and imagination linking perceptions.
- The feeling of continuity is a fiction created by associative principles.
- Metaphysical notions of an immaterial soul are rejected as unsubstantiated.
- Anthropomorphic projections onto entities like God highlight the self's finite, comprehensible nature.

### The Nature of Emotion
- Emotions are impressions of reflection, arising from ideas of pleasure or pain, and are more vivid than mere thoughts.
- They motivate action, while reason is inert and serves as their "slave."
- Passions can be calm (e.g., benevolence) or violent (e.g., anger), and are explained naturalistically via association.
- Emotions like fear and hope drive religious beliefs, not rational inference.
- Sympathy transmits emotions between people, influencing moral and social judgments.

### The Nature (or Existence) of Unconscious Mental Activity
- Hume does not explicitly posit unconscious activity; all mental contents are conscious impressions or ideas.
- Associative habits and customs operate as "gentle forces" but within conscious thought.
- Mental processes are fully derivable from impressions, with no room for hidden mechanisms.
- Ideas may influence without deliberate reflection, but this is habitual rather than truly unconscious.
- Inferences suggest mental activity is transparent and empirical, not subterranean.

### The Nature of Psychological Projection and Its Role in the Acquisition (or Failure to Acquire) Knowledge
- Projection occurs through sympathy and association, where we attribute our feelings or qualities to others or objects.
- It aids knowledge by enabling empathy and shared understanding, e.g., inferring others' motives.
- However, it can distort reality, leading to false beliefs like anthropomorphism in religion.
- Weak associations (e.g., with distant others) hinder accurate projection and thus knowledge.
- In causal inferences, habitual projection creates the illusion of necessary connections.

### Rationalization
- Rationalization involves reason inventing post-hoc justifications for actions driven by passions.
- Reason cannot motivate; it only serves sentiments, leading to self-deception.
- In morals, we rationalize faults through self-love, distorting judgments.
- Theodicies (justifying evil) are empty rationalizations that fail under scrutiny.
- Rationalization rarely yields genuine insight and often perpetuates errors.

### Man's Inborn Instinctual Endowment
- Humans are born with associative principles: resemblance, contiguity, and causation, which are original and unexplained.
- Instincts like self-preservation, benevolence, and sympathy form the basis of social and moral behavior.
- These are stronger than reason in motivating action and belief formation.
- Infants display instincts prior to education, shaping thought and society.
- Fear and hope as instincts drive religious origins and human responses to misery.

### The Nature of Human Freedom (or Its Absence)
- Absolute freedom is an illusion; actions are determined by passions, habits, and custom.
- Liberty means acting according to one's will without external constraint, but the will itself is caused.
- Reason does not confer freedom, as it cannot oppose or motivate passions.
- The feeling of freedom arises from internal determinations, not true indeterminacy.
- In religious contexts, finite limitations imply necessity over free benevolence.

### Determinism
- Every event, including human actions, is determined by prior causes via constant conjunctions.
- The principle of causation applies uniformly to mind and matter, based on experience.
- Determinism is a strong presumption from habitual uniformity, not a necessary truth.
- No events are truly contingent; all follow necessary chains observable in nature.
- Hypotheses beyond experience (e.g., uncaused events) are rejected.

### Determinism in Relation to Freedom
- Determinism and freedom are compatible (compatibilism): freedom is liberty of spontaneity, not indifference.
- If actions are necessitated by internal causes, responsibility remains intact.
- The debate is often verbal; necessity is essential to moral accountability.
- Absolute freedom contradicts causal uniformity and leads to absurdity.
- In theology, determinism fits a finite or indifferent deity better than infinite freedom.

### Historiography
- History should be empirical, based on observation and evidence, avoiding hypothetical systems.
- Historians must aim for impartiality, though human passions influence events and narratives.
- Probability guides historical accounts, drawing on causal explanations from human nature.
- History is part of moral philosophy, revealing patterns in behavior via experience.
- Bias can be mitigated by focusing on facts and constant conjunctions.

### Religion
- Religious beliefs originate from fear, hope, and superstition, not reason.
- Arguments for God (e.g., design) are weak analogies, undermined by evil and dissimilarity.
- Miracles violate nature's uniformity and lack credible testimony.
- Natural religion's concepts (e.g., infinite God) lack intelligible content.
- Organized religion fosters enthusiasm and corruption, opposed to true philosophy.

### The History of Religion
- Religion evolves from polytheism (driven by fear of unknown powers) to monotheism via refinement.
- It arises from human misery, anxiety, and imagination, not rational inquiry.
- Changes are psychological: fear and hope corrupt doctrines over time.
- Common patterns include rise from superstition and decline through corruption or reason.
- Religion interacts with civil authority, often leading to fanaticism or tolerance.

### Morality
- Morality is founded on sentiment (approval/disapproval), not reason or divine command.
- Virtues are those useful or agreeable to self or others, discerned via sympathy.
- Natural virtues (e.g., benevolence) are innate; artificial ones (e.g., justice) arise from conventions.
- Moral judgments are universal in principle but relative to human nature.
- Self-interest and utility play roles, but sympathy enables impartiality.

### Aesthetics
- Beauty resides in sentiment, arising from what is agreeable to the imagination or useful.
- Aesthetic judgments claim some objectivity through a general point of view and sympathy.
- Standards of taste emerge from uniform human responses to forms and qualities.
- Beauty in nature (e.g., contrivance) suggests design but is probabilistic.
- Emotions and reason interplay, with sentiment dominating aesthetic experience.
