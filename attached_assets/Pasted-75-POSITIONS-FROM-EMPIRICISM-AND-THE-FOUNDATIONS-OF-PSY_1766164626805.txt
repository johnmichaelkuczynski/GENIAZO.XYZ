75 POSITIONS FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY
by John-Michael Kuczynski
============================================================================

CRITIQUE OF EMPIRICISM
----------------------
1. Empiricism forces the external world to appear as nothing more than a collection of mutually disconnected, ex nihilo events, since all there is to it is what observation reveals.
2. To the extent a scientist complies with the empiricist credo that one must "stick to the facts," he cannot embed observable events in otherwise unobservable continuities.
3. The empiricist, forced to hold that events occur spontaneously, is ipso facto incapable of explaining them.
4. If completely described by conscious experience alone, a person's mind would consist of spontaneities flanked by lapses in consciousness that would themselves be spontaneities.
5. Empiricism is inimical to the idea of any invisible structure.
6. The term "empirical thought" is an oxymoron: to the extent that thought mediates between one's observations and one's beliefs, the latter are not directly supported by observation.
7. Most philosophers describe themselves as empiricists; most really are empiricists, making heavy concessions to empiricism even when those concessions lack empiricism-independent justification.
8. Empiricism-based or empiricism-inspired methodologies have damaged psychology.
9. Hume accepted skepticism about sense-perception and induction on the grounds that they were corollaries of empiricism, instead of rejecting empiricism for that reason.
10. Mach's characteristically empiricist position that molecules are but useful fictions was proven wrong by Einstein's work on Brownian motion.

NON-SPATIOTEMPORAL ENTITIES
---------------------------
11. Propositions are non-spatiotemporal entities.
12. Properties are non-spatiotemporal.
13. The spatiotemporal world comprises no instances of any logical relations.
14. Propositions consist of properties.
15. There are five logical relations that may hold between propositions: entailment, confirmation, disconfirmation, incompatibility, and neutrality.
16. The relata of logical relations must be things that are true or false.
17. Properties cannot be identified with spatiotemporal entities whose constituents are that property's instances (scattered objects).
18. Any two uninstantiated properties would be identical if properties were identical with scattered objects—which is obviously false.
19. When a property ceases to be instantiated, it ceases to be instantiated but does not cease to exist.
20. Empiricists deny that propositions exist because propositions, if they exist, are non-spatiotemporal.

PROPOSITIONS AND MEANING
------------------------
21. A proposition is what one affirms when one makes a statement; it is not identical with any sentence.
22. The same proposition can be the meaning of distinct sentences.
23. Propositions consist of concepts.
24. The meaning of a complex expression cannot be directly determined by convention; one must always figure out what is meant.
25. Sentences, not propositions, being the relata of logical relations is an empiricist view that fails.
26. It is really meanings (propositions) that entail one another; expressions entail each other only in a derivative sense.
27. It is only in a doubly derivative sense that one expression entails another.
28. Statements to the effect that a sentence is "formally true" or an argument is "formally valid" are abbreviated ways of making statements about propositions.
29. Empiricists attempt to spatiotemporalize meaning, and these attempts fail as badly as their attempts to spatiotemporalize properties.
30. Wittgenstein's thesis that "meaning is use" cannot be correct, as it would imply linguistic activity could occur on planets with no sentient life.

CONSTITUTIVE VS. CAUSAL DEPENDENCE
----------------------------------
31. To say that x "mediates" y is to say that y's existence constitutively depends on x's—meaning the things composing y are identical with (a subset of) the things composing x.
32. Constitutive dependence differs from causal dependence: a house's existence is constitutively, not causally, dependent on its bricks.
33. One must distinguish the statement that X's parts are governed by laws L from the non-equivalent statement that X itself is governed by those laws.
34. One must distinguish the statement that X complies with the same laws as Y from the non-equivalent statement that X-internal events are to be explained in terms of the same principles as Y-internal events.

PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY
-------------------------
35. Everything said about the relationship between physiology and microphysics holds of the relationship between psychology and physiology.
36. Psychology and physiology are even more remote from each other than physiology and microphysics.
37. Every proposition of every discipline other than psychology represents facts as being in a common spatiotemporal coordinate system; psychological propositions categorically do not.
38. Your perception of a collision, though given as occurring in the same temporal manifold as the collision, is not given as occurring in the same spatial manifold.
39. The explanatory generalizations of a given discipline consist of concepts distinct from those composing the explanatory generalizations of other disciplines.
40. No physicalistic statements (concerning the spatiotemporal realm involving no psychological concepts) explain why mentalistic statements are true.

CAUSATION
---------
41. The distinctively empiricist position (Hume's) holds that we see events but do not see forces, therefore we are not entitled to say that anything makes anything happen.
42. This empiricist position on causation holds that statements of the form "given x, y had to happen" are categorically false.
43. Causes do make effects happen; there are genuine causal forces, not merely regularities.
44. Ernest Nagel's The Structure of Science assumes the cogency of Humean causation, which sullies this otherwise magisterial work.

SUBPERSONAL MENTATION
---------------------
45. There is subpersonal thought—unconscious thought that underlies conscious, pre-conscious, and repressed ideation.
46. The cognitive operations that mediate vision, language-comprehension, and musical ability are subpersonal.
47. Your mind figures out how to convert sensory disturbances into visual images—but not you, i.e., not your self.
48. It would be viciously regressive to say that you—your self—carried out cognitive operations underlying sense-perception.
49. Subpersonal, non-iconic ideation becomes hewed to sequences of expression-images in the way geometrical propositions can be hewed to arithmetical propositions.
50. Concepts are not constituents of consciousness; so far as they are conscious, they are access-conscious, not consciousness-constitutive.

LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT
--------------------
51. Although symbol-manipulations facilitate ratiocinative operations, anything that one can think with the help of symbols one can think without them.
52. Linguistic competence enhances cognitive competence; knowing a language makes one more intelligent than one would otherwise be.
53. The relationship borne by Adam Smith's cognitive competence to his linguistic competence is constitutive, not causal.
54. Linguistic competence is a component of cognitive competence, not merely a precursor of it.
55. It seems to be a conceptual necessity, not an idiosyncrasy of human psychology, that complex cogitations need linguistic vehicles.
56. One's having the cognitive wherewithal to write a treatise is constitutively related to one's linguistic competence.
57. Berkeley was right that we don't grasp universals except by way of linguistic symbols, but wrong that our minds cannot grasp universals non-linguistically.
58. Our minds must grasp universals non-linguistically if linguistic expressions are to mean anything to us.
59. Berkeley conflated images with concepts, using "idea" to refer to both.

EMPIRICISM AND PERCEPTION
-------------------------
60. Perception is not mere sensation; perceptions are articulated sensations, and the articulations correspond to conceptual knowledge.
61. There is probably a conceptual dimension to perception.
62. Different expressions are associated with different kinds of phenomenology.
63. Congenial phenomenology alerts us to the presence of positive properties (truthfulness, validity) in expression-image series.
64. Pleasant affects alert us to structural features in works of music, paintings, or buildings; unpleasant affects alert us to their absence.

EMOTIONS AND EMPIRICIST ERROR
-----------------------------
65. Empiricists are forced to espouse radically implausible views concerning affect and emotion because they mistakenly treat relations as properties.
66. Colors, tastes, and fragrances are not "purely" subjective as empiricists claim.
67. Colors are properties of three-place relations, not two-place relations between observer and object.
68. The empiricist wrongly puts a headache in the same category as concern for a child's welfare, treating each as equally non-cognitive "sentiment."
69. If you stopped caring about your kidnapped child's welfare, your sphere of awareness would have shrunk; stopping a headache would not diminish awareness.

PSYCHOPATHY AND SOCIOPATHY
--------------------------
70. A psychopath is someone who doesn't have a conscience and never had one to begin with.
71. A sociopath is someone who had a conscience but ceased to have one.
72. Sociopathogenesis is identical with, or largely constitutive of, a certain sort of rationalization.
73. Sociopaths are people who "sell out" and "die inside," becoming empty husks that are but caricatures of their former selves.
74. Psychopathy is a kind of perpetual infantilism.
75. Unlike the sociopath, the psychopath never sold out; he had nothing to sell because he never had values.

100 POSITIONS FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY (Part 2)
by John-Michael Kuczynski
============================================================================

TWO TYPES OF EMPIRICISM
-----------------------
1. There are two very different kinds of empiricism: one holds that all knowledge is based on sense-perception; the other holds that all knowledge is based on experience.
2. According to the first type, we take for granted that sense-perceptions are correct and know nothing not directly supported by them; Skinner was an empiricist of this sort.
3. According to the second type, experience (as opposed to mere sense-perception) is our epistemic starting point.
4. Type-2 empiricism generates the paradox that experiences are our epistemic starting point, yet it is not through observation that we know of these experiences.
5. Type-2 empiricism seems to entail that we have non-observational, empirical knowledge—a contradiction in terms.

INDUCTION AND SOLIPSISM
-----------------------
6. It would be a singularity of unprecedented proportions if, of the billions of people physiologically just like me, I was the only one whose physiology mediated mental activity.
7. The counter-inductiveness inherent in positing such a singularity is compounded by the fact that other people's behavior is easily explained and predicted only if my situation isn't such a singularity.
8. A given instance of some kind of metal won't have a certain coefficient of expansion unless all other such instances have the same coefficient—and the same holds for biological traits.

EMPIRICISM AND PSYCHOLOGY
-------------------------
9. Empiricism is systemically incapable of saying anything about how linguistic and cognitive competence affect character-architecture.
10. Empiricists cannot distinguish between urges and desires; between desires and intentions; or between intentions and values.
11. Each such distinction is to be understood in structural, not phenomenological terms, and empiricists necessarily overvalue what is to be learned about mental states from their phenomenology.
12. Because empiricists are forced to cram all of the mind's contents into consciousness, they have no choice but to see emotions and values as mere "sentiments."
13. The sensibility embodied in empiricism is inimical to the creation and cultivation of viable psychological theories.
14. For epistemologists, empiricism is a doctrine; for others, it's a mentality that damages research even when researchers don't know what empiricism formally entails.

DESIRES, URGES, AND VALUES
--------------------------
15. Desires are judgments: they are judgments as to what will minimize distress or maximize pleasure.
16. An urge is not a judgment; it is a psychological disturbance whose cause is disruption of metabolic equilibrium, precipitating action likely to restore that equilibrium.
17. A value is a belief on a creature's part as to what, in general, it must do to consolidate or augment its agency.
18. The first value is given by the proposition: x has value for y if y's agency depends on x.
19. All acts—all intention-driven behaviors—are value-driven; sometimes those values make provisions for the welfare of others.
20. Any agent necessarily believes (at some level) that his act will benefit him, but this does not mean all acts are selfish.
21. Creatures that don't have values are, for that very reason, non-people.

SELFHOOD AND AGENCY
-------------------
22. A self is a mind whose host-body exists to serve it; whereas the snake's mind exists to serve the snake's body, your body exists to serve your mind.
23. You don't identify with your body: you can imagine waking up in someone else's body, but not in someone else's mind.
24. Software is implemented by hardware, but it is only to the extent that hardware mediates activity of a certain kind that it can constitute a computer.
25. Selves are minds that have values; a mind that simply facilitates the gratification of instincts has no values.
26. A mind does have values if it sees the gratification of instincts, and maintenance of physical well-being, as mere means to its own welfare.

PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES
-----------------------
27. x's fearing that y will win consists in the proposition "y will win" being presented to x as likely to be true and likely to have adverse consequences for x's existence.
28. z's hoping that y will win consists in the proposition "y will win" being presented to z as having positive consequences, supposing it true, for z's existence.
29. Different propositional attitudes towards a single proposition are acceptances of distinct propositions that have a common propositional part.

OBSERVATION AND CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE
------------------------------------
30. Observations are not homogenous dollops of phenomenology: they are conceptually articulated.
31. Embodied in every observation is conceptual knowledge; this holds no less of the simplest sense-perceptions.
32. Conceptual knowledge pervades perceptual knowledge, even knowledge that is as strictly based as possible on sense-perception.
33. It is often a conceptual, non-empirical question how to characterize a given body of data in a strictly empirical fashion.
34. For this reason, empiricism undermines itself.

HUME ON FORCE-PERCEPTION
------------------------
35. Hume denied that we are perceptually aware of forces by decomposing apparent force-perception into four other awarenesses: intention, tactile perception, displeasure sensation, and motion perception.
36. This Humean analysis is decidedly artificial and obviously post hoc.

SELF-OBSERVATION PARADOX
------------------------
37. Self-observing involves being so mentally configured that one's mental states become objects of awareness.
38. Facts about one's physical body aren't facts about one's self at all.
39. Do you believe that 2 + 2 = 4? Yes. Did you have to self-observe to answer that question? No—yet that knowledge is empirical.

PROPERTIES AND EXISTENCE
------------------------
40. If properties don't exist, no argument involving properties is valid—but arguments are composed of propositions, and propositions consist of properties.
41. Properties cannot be identified with scattered objects or any spatiotemporal entities.
42. Redness is a 3-place relation; roundness is also a 3-place relation (relative to an inertial framework and an object stipulated to be straight).
43. Given any spatiotemporal object O, one can destroy or rearrange O without affecting the properties that O instantiates.
44. It is self-defeating to deny the existence of properties, since to do so is to believe that the property of being non-spatiotemporal is not instantiated.
45. Embedded within any given cognizance is a presupposition to the effect that certain properties exist.

ANALYTIC TRUTH
--------------
46. Only trivial analytic truths hold in virtue of synonymy relations; non-trivial ones don't.
47. An analytic truth is one that holds in virtue of facts about the structures of properties.
48. "Analyticity" is non-circularly definable: an analytic truth holds entirely in virtue of the structures of the properties composing it.
49. Quine's argument that there is no non-circular definition of "analytic" fails because it only considers trivial analytic truths.
50. Quine would be begging the question if he denied the existence of properties, since in alleging all truths are empirical, he is denying non-spatiotemporal entities.

LOGIC AND PROPOSITIONS
----------------------
51. A system of logic is the least inclusive set containing certain axioms and the consequences of those axioms.
52. Formal truth is a relation between sentences and sets of axioms, not a property of sentences.
53. Relative to one axiom-set, "if John knows that snow is white, John believes that snow is white" is formally true; relative to others, it isn't.
54. Given any sentence S, there is some axiom-set relative to which S is formally true.
55. Logic doesn't concern linguistic expressions; the Law of Non-Contradiction is clearly true, yet practically any natural language sentence contains context-sensitive components.
56. Kurt Gödel cogently defended the position that logic concerns propositions, not expressions, in his 1953 paper "Is mathematics syntax of language?"

CONVENTION AND MEANING
----------------------
57. It isn't a matter of convention whether the conventions we adopt are consistent with one another.
58. It isn't a matter of convention what follows from the conventions we adopt.
59. It is a mind-independent, non-empirical fact how conventions are to be applied to arguments and thus whether arguments are valid.
60. Expression-types are instances of relations between conventions of a certain kind and meanings.

SETS AND PROPERTIES
-------------------
61. No intension is identical with the corresponding extension; no property is identical with the corresponding set.
62. Sets are properties: the set of apples is identical with the property of being the property of being an apple.
63. x falls into a set S if, and only if, x is an instance of an instance of the property that constitutes S.

MUSICAL AND ARTISTIC WORKS
--------------------------
64. Musical and artistic works are properties, not spatiotemporal entities.
65. It makes sense to ask "how many times has that work been played?" (i.e., how many instances of that work are there), showing works are instantiable.

PERCEPTION AND REPRESENTATION
-----------------------------
66. Representations have conditions of satisfaction; for a perception to be accurate, it must have conditions of satisfaction, not merely be caused by something.
67. For a perception p to have conditions of satisfaction is for there to be some property P such that p is veridical iff P is instantiated.
68. The existence of properties follows from the fact that there is anything that has any content, whether true or false.
69. False beliefs have contents: if they didn't, they wouldn't be false—they'd be neither true nor false.
70. Hallucinations have contents: if they didn't, they wouldn't be inaccurate—they'd be neither accurate nor inaccurate.

CONTENT EXTERNALISM REFUTED
---------------------------
71. Content externalism holds that the content of perceptions and beliefs is determined by their provenance (causal history).
72. If content is determined by provenance, then hallucinations would be devoid of content or have gaps where objects are "supposed to be."
73. It cannot coherently be maintained that hallucinations are devoid of content or less content-rich than their veridical counterparts.
74. A hallucination qualitatively identical to a perception has the same content; there are no gaps in its content (except such as are also present in the corresponding perception).
75. For this reason, content externalism is simply false.

PERCEPTUAL CONTENT IS GENERAL
-----------------------------
76. The content of any given cognizance is general.
77. What you see is not that Tim is standing over there, but that an entity with certain features is standing over there; you then conclude it's Tim.
78. A given perception's content, if propositionalized, is given by a proposition to the effect that there exists something x having properties P1...Pn.
79. There is no particular thing that must have those properties if your perception is to be accurate.
80. Given any cognizance, there is ultimately no one entity that must have the properties in question if that cognizance is to be accurate.

EMPIRICISM AND SKEPTICISM
-------------------------
81. If all questions are to be decided on empirical grounds, then it is an open empirical question what degree of support any datum gives to any hypothesis—and so on ad infinitum.
82. It cannot be known through our senses that our senses are correct.
83. Strict empiricism leads either to skepticism (we cannot know whether our senses are trustworthy) or idealism (our senses are trustworthy because perceptions are their objects).
84. No one would advocate either view if he had any way of avoiding doing so; the way to avoid it involves being a rationalist.

KNOWING VS. BEING AWARE
-----------------------
85. There is a difference between knowing that R is round and being aware of R's roundness.
86. In knowing that R is round, the object of awareness is a proposition (non-spatiotemporal); in being aware of R's roundness, the object is spatiotemporal.
87. Only proposition-aware creatures can grasp incompatibilities between states of affairs.

OBSERVATION REPORTS
-------------------
88. Very little of what we know, if stated exhaustively and perspicuously, would be given by simple "observation reports."
89. In describing what you see as a red ball, you are implicitly judging how it would act if acted upon, what it will do when acted upon, and how other objects would behave near it.
90. Telescoped into everyday "strictly observation-based" judgments are judgments as to what would happen, could happen, and will happen.

WITTGENSTEIN'S PICTURE THEORY
-----------------------------
91. The Picture Theory holds that sentences are meaningful by depicting possible facts; there is no need for propositions to mediate between sentences and facts.
92. The Picture Theory is unacceptable: if there are propositions, the meaningfulness of false sentences is easily explained.
93. Wittgenstein must concede that a sentence's meaning is determined by its truth-conditions, not by the fact it depicts.
94. Truth-conditions are propositions; in granting that sentences have truth-conditions, Wittgenstein concedes the existence of propositions.
95. Given the existence of propositions, one can account for the meaningfulness of sentences without the Picture Theory.
96. Many true statements affirm that what makes them true cannot be depicted; e.g., "some things cannot be depicted."

FALSE THOUGHTS AND ERROR
------------------------
97. For there to be such a thing as error, there must be propositions that are presented to some creature as being instantiated that are not instantiated.
98. It is an empirical fact that there exist things (thoughts, perceptions) that have contents.
99. Given any thought T, there is some property P such that P's being instantiated or not is identical with T's being true or false—this is a non-empirical truth.
100. Causal processes would mean nothing to us and bear evidence of nothing unless we had causal-process-independent knowledge of non-spatiotemporal entities.

100 POSITIONS FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY (Part 3)
by John-Michael Kuczynski
============================================================================

SENTENCE MEANING AND STRUCTURE
------------------------------
1. A sentence is meaningful if it attributes some property to some object—if, for some object x and some property phi, it says that x has phi.
2. A sentence is meaningful if it says anything about anything.
3. Expressions like "the absolute is one" contain undefined terms and therefore say nothing until those terms are assigned referents.
4. The reason "x is tall" says nothing is that "x" is undefined—it hasn't been assigned a referent.
5. Before a variable is assigned a referent, expressions containing it are neither confirmable nor tautologous.

RUSSELL'S PARADOX AND MEANINGLESSNESS
-------------------------------------
6. Russell, Tarski, and other logicians held there are meaningless bona fide sentences, but they were quite wrong.
7. The expressions they were thinking of are either false or they are sentence-schemata, not actual sentences.
8. A sentence-schema is an expression just like a sentence except that one of the lexical items has been replaced with a variable.
9. "The property of not being a member of itself" does not have a referent; it just appears to have a sense.
10. The question "what property must a thing have to belong to K [the class of non-self-members]?" receives only circular answers.
11. K₁ ("K is a member of itself") fails to encode a proposition because the occurrence of "itself" doesn't refer to anything.
12. Russell's Paradox is not a counterexample to the Axiom of Comprehension because it doesn't express a proposition.

ANTINOMIES AND SEMANTIC RULES
-----------------------------
13. There are two classes of antinomies: those that are meaningless (neither true nor false) and those that are false.
14. Russell's Paradox is an instance of the meaningless class.
15. Tokens of "this sentence is false" are neither true nor false—so they are not both true and false.
16. The semantic rules of English do not permit the construction of sentences that violate the Law of Non-Contradiction.
17. A sentence-token's proposition depends on what its parts refer to; if they refer to nothing, the token is neither true nor false.
18. Many logicians wrongly argued that English was defective because they misunderstood self-referential sentences.

MEANING VS. USE (AGAINST WITTGENSTEIN)
--------------------------------------
19. Meaning cannot be use: there are meaningful expressions that are never used literally and infinitely many that aren't used at all.
20. Once you know what a given expression means, you won't acquire new knowledge about that meaning by acquiring additional knowledge of how that word is used.
21. What a sentence conveys is the vector sum of its literal meaning and contextual facts.
22. A sentence has a fixed, circumstance-invariant meaning, but the significance of that meaning is circumstance-dependent.
23. For anyone to say anything, words must have meanings, and there must be true propositions saying what those meanings are—these are semantic rules.
24. Noise-production that isn't governed by knowledge of semantic rules is not linguistic.
25. Duly rule-governed usage of an expression is governed by, and therefore doesn't constitute, its meaning.

CONCEPTS AND UNDERSTANDING
--------------------------
26. To understand the concept of number is not merely to know how "number" is used—one must grasp the concept to identify which word's usage to study.
27. In deepening one's understanding of numbers (e.g., learning integers are second-order properties), one is not adding to semantic knowledge.
28. Semantic analysis (what linguists do) must not be confused with conceptual analysis (what philosophers do) or objectual analysis (what chemists do).

WORD-INDIVIDUATION
------------------
29. Two different sounds are tokens of the same word if: (i) they are produced by bona fide speakers, (ii) they sound similar enough to some paradigm, and (iii) they are instances of genuine speech.
30. Part of what makes a token of "dog" be a token of that word is what it sounds like—but words are not individuated strictly by acoustical properties.
31. Sentence-types are not individuated by the physical properties of their tokens; meaning plays an essential role.

WITTGENSTEIN'S RULE-FOLLOWING ARGUMENT
--------------------------------------
32. Wittgenstein argues that merely grasping a rule F(x) explains nothing about a person's behavior or knowledge that F(13) = 169.
33. Wittgenstein concludes that to know how to apply a rule, one must know other rules, leading to infinite regress.
34. This argument fails because knowledge of how to apply a rule is built into knowledge of the rule itself.
35. The distinction between competence and performance explains why someone can grasp F(x) = x² without immediately knowing the square of 1,198,976.
36. Competence is ability; performance is the ability to deploy ability.
37. If linguistic competence is to operate at full force, other abilities must be intact: memory, focus, patience, etc.
38. There is no gulf between knowing a given principle and knowing how to apply it under given circumstances.

THINKING IS NOT STRICTLY PSYCHOLOGICAL
--------------------------------------
39. Rule-following is not a strictly psychological phenomenon.
40. Given only that we've attributed a grasp of F(x) = x² to some person, we've explained nothing about him psychologically.
41. The difference between someone who understands why F(13) = 169 and someone who believes it for spurious reasons is not psychological.
42. Conventional wisdom holds that thinking is a psychological process; this is not so—thinking is not a psychological process.

CONSCIOUSNESS AND THOUGHT
-------------------------
43. Propositional attitudes are not constituents of consciousness.
44. The deployment of a propositional attitude is not constitutive of consciousness.
45. Consciousness is to thinking what a driver is to events under his car's hood: the driver can initiate, regulate, and end processes but has little knowledge of what happens inside.
46. When working, I decide what to try to solve, whether a solution is good, and when to stop—but these decision points are singularities; mostly I am waiting.

MENTAL IMAGERY AND THOUGHT
--------------------------
47. Contrary to Wittgenstein, mental imagery sometimes is thought-constitutive.
48. Thought-constitutive mental images are segments of ratiocinations that for the most part do not consist of imagery.
49. Phenomenologically consecutive images are likely to be ratiocinatively disjoint.
50. If one considers images as installments in a thought-process (most of whose installments are not images), their occurrences make perfect sense.
51. Wittgenstein tried to understand mental imagery in isolation of its ratiocinative context and thus had no choice but to see such images as cognitively empty.

PRIVATE LANGUAGE ARGUMENT REFUTED
---------------------------------
52. Wittgenstein argues that private language is impossible because there's no one to penalize mistakes—but it isn't always other people who penalize misuse.
53. The private linguist who misuses a word is responsible for a language-shift, not a meaningless utterance.
54. Any language is only as useful to its speakers as their memories of its semantic rules are good.
55. At the end of the day, even the English speaker has nothing but his memories to rely on regarding word meanings.
56. The difference between private language and English is that in the latter there are multiple back-up copies of semantic rules—but this doesn't make one more of a language than the other.
57. A manuscript of which there are many copies is not more of a manuscript than one of which there is only one.

WITTGENSTEIN'S EMPIRICISM
-------------------------
58. Wittgenstein is a hard-core empiricist.
59. Wittgenstein's refusal to grant the existence of non-spatiotemporal entities (propositions, concepts) stems from his empiricism.
60. Empiricism, of the non-Berkeleyan sort, taken to its logical conclusion, reduces thought to bodily behaviors.
61. Creatures in whom there are no "occult processes" are zombies, and zombies cannot be acculturated.
62. There is no plausibility to the view that groups of appropriately interrelated zombies collectively think.

QUINE AND PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES
---------------------------------
63. Some empiricists deny that there are propositional attitudes—they deny that anyone believes anything or regrets anything.
64. Quine took the desperate measure of saying that no sentence is a translation of any sentence.
65. Quine insists that when translating, one cannot rely on any beliefs based in one's knowledge of oneself.
66. This is not the view of somebody who goes where the data takes him—it is a consequence of strict fidelity to empiricism.

ARGUMENT FROM ANALOGY
---------------------
67. The traditional Argument from Analogy holds: I know my mental states correlate with my behavior; others' external behavior matches mine; therefore their internal states must also match.
68. Wittgenstein rejects this, saying one cannot reasonably infer that others have mental states from knowledge of one's own.
69. Wittgenstein's reasoning is spurious: we know from experience that sometimes one instance suffices for reliable generalizations.

TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE
------------------
70. There is a difference between knowledge that is a constituent of consciousness and knowledge that is merely access-conscious.
71. My knowledge that 10 + 11 = 21 is "conscious" in that it is a constituent of my mind and I can readily become conscious of it.
72. Type-(iii) knowledge (empirical observation) must not be confused with type-(iv) knowledge (introspective).
73. Hume conflated type-(iii) knowledge with type-(iv) knowledge when he searched for the self through introspection.
74. Knowledge of one's conscious condition is empirical in that it is a conceptualization of experience, like a scientific theory—not a direct derivative of experience.

ANALYTIC TRUTHS
---------------
75. Definitions are not analytic; "a yard is a distance of three feet" describes an empirical fact about linguistic usage.
76. There are "deep analytic truths" such as: that orange isn't red; that nothing that is green is colorless; that anything moving is in motion.
77. Some analytic truths are absolutely primitive; some are absolutely non-primitive.
78. If it is only by grasping "orange = yellow + red" that one grasps "orange isn't red," then one does not genuinely grasp the latter.

KANT'S SYNTHETIC A PRIORI (CRITIQUE)
------------------------------------
79. Kant argued that 7 + 5 = 12 is synthetic a priori because when thinking "7 + 5," one doesn't necessarily think "12."
80. This argument conflates non-empirical knowledge with psychological (introspective) knowledge.
81. Kant uses "transcendental" instead of "psychological" to obfuscate his error of making mathematics a branch of psychology.
82. Geometrical propositions are non-empirical but also non-analytic, Kant claimed—but his reasoning confuses conceptual analysis with mental imagery.
83. Mental imagery is a vehicle for geometrical thought, but it isn't by introspecting images that one knows geometrical truths.

HUME ON THE SELF (CRITIQUE)
---------------------------
84. Hume claimed that when he introspects, he finds only sensations and images but never a self.
85. This argument conflates type-(iii) knowledge with type-(iv) knowledge.
86. Supposing Hume had a self, he couldn't know it through sense-perception—but that doesn't mean he must know it through inward "vision."
87. Hume believes that 1 + 1 = 2 and knows he believes it—but it isn't by rummaging through mental imagery that he knows this.

SUBPERSONAL MENTATION
---------------------
88. Animals must have concepts given they obviously have sense-perceptions—but it is their minds, not their selves, that grasp abstracta.
89. Rover's brain mediates deeply unconscious ideation that is impersonal (unlike the Freudian unconscious).
90. The Freudian unconscious is access-unconscious but often was or will be access-conscious; subpersonal ideation is intrinsically different.
91. There is an obvious sense in which dogs are non-concipient, yet concipience is a sine qua non for percipience, and dogs are percipient.
92. These facts can be reconciled only by distinguishing self from mind—the part one identifies with from the unconscious part one does not.
93. Chomsky's position that there is subpersonal mentation is not merely a reasonable hypothesis but de rigueur relative to obvious facts.

HUSSERL'S PHENOMENOLOGY (CRITIQUE)
----------------------------------
94. Husserl tried to purify introspection by "bracketing" all assumptions—but this involves deconceptualizing introspections, which is impossible.
95. When I describe a perception, I do so by describing its object; I cannot suspend beliefs like "there is an external world."
96. The justification for perception cannot come from perception and must come from non-empirical, analytic principles.
97. If a perception is described without accepting non-empirical principles, all that's left is conceptually unarticulated phenomenology.
98. Qua student of the mind, one cannot be a strict empiricist; qua student of the external world, one also cannot be a strict empiricist.

EMPIRICISM'S LEGACY TO PSYCHOLOGY
---------------------------------
99. The mental, under empiricism, isn't a unified domain—it's a series of disjoint ex nihilo obtrusions into an otherwise integrated world.
100. Science is not about "sticking to the facts"—it is about organizing facts and positing hidden structures to restore continuities that observation strips away.

POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY
================================================================================

SUBPERSONAL MENTATION AND CONSCIOUSNESS
----------------------------------------
1. Paraperception is sub-personal truth-awareness embodied in personal object-awareness.
2. The delight one takes in listening to a Bach fugue embodies subpersonal awareness of truths about structural properties of sounds.
3. Subpersonal awarenesses are expressed at the personal level in the form of phenomenological episodes.
4. Subpersonal knowledge is never transferred from one mental stratum to another.
5. Conscious knowledge of subpersonal processes (e.g., via Chomsky/Marr) is merely an analogue of the subpersonal knowledge described, not a bona fide duplicate.
6. Conscious knowledge of subpersonal processes is schematic and theoretical, like our knowledge of electrons.
7. The view that sub-personal processes are strictly physiological and embody no intelligence is indefensible.
8. Understanding a novel sentence of one's native tongue instantaneously requires more than purely reflexive physiological processes.
9. The English language is a collection of rules, and semantic rules are highly complex.
10. People absorb and apply complex semantic rules without the slightest difficulty, despite being unable to consciously articulate them.
11. Linguistic competence is naturally characterized as mastery of semantic rules that are not access-conscious.
12. Subpersonal semantic rules are either access-unconscious in a deep sense or they don't exist—there is no viable purely physiological characterization.

CONSCIOUSNESS AND PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES
------------------------------------------
13. Mentality and consciousness are not identical.
14. Propositional attitudes cannot be constituents of consciousness; when "conscious," they are access-conscious.
15. There is no a priori reason why anything that is access-conscious must be so.
16. Any given consciousness must be distinct from its object—the two must not be numerically identical.
17. Distinct objects are such that the existence of one is not logically dependent on the existence of the other.
18. There is no a priori reason why propositional attitudes must be access-conscious.
19. Consciousness can have trouble accessing a given propositional attitude, just as computers can have trouble accessing their own contents.
20. It often takes considerable intellectual resources to be consciously aware of just what one believes.
21. Even if beliefs are access-conscious (not repressed), one may lack the meta-cognitive wherewithal to conceptualize them properly.
22. It's one thing to have first-order representations; it's quite another to correctly conceive of that cognitive wherewithal.
23. Without meta-cognitive wherewithal, one cannot know what one's propositional attitudes are.

CRITIQUE OF SEARLE'S VIEW (MENTALITY = CONSCIOUSNESS)
------------------------------------------------------
24. Searle's view (SV) that mentality is identical with consciousness is logically false.
25. MC entails that whatever is part of your mind but not your consciousness exists only as a disposition to have conscious experiences.
26. Any dispositions you have are mediated by physiological structures.
27. Searle's dispositionalism about non-consciousness-constitutive mental entities follows from his acceptance that mentality equals consciousness.
28. Dispositionalism doesn't model the data about beliefs and knowledge.
29. If intentions existed only as dispositions, we couldn't explain why they are activated by relevant stimuli.
30. Non-occurrent mental structures function as mental entities between bouts of generating consciousness-constitutive states.
31. Searle commits the quantifier-shift fallacy: from "each act accords with some rule" it doesn't follow that "some one rule is accorded with by each act."
32. Two speakers assigning the same meanings to infinitely many sentences cannot be explained as physiological coincidence.

HUME'S ANALYSIS OF CAUSALITY
----------------------------
33. Hume holds that "x causes y" is true only if taken to say that a pair of spatiotemporally adjacent events instantiates a regularity.
34. Hume denies that any event disposes another event to occur.
35. Hume's analysis (HC) doesn't distinguish actual from epiphenomenal causality.
36. HC falsely implies that night causes day (and vice versa) since they are regularly conjoined.
37. Animal agitation preceding earthquakes doesn't cause earthquakes, even though the conjunction is regular—showing HC's inadequacy.
38. Our intuitions about what causes what are not what they would be if Hume's analysis were correct.
39. Any given case of pseudo-causation involves discontinuities not involved in genuine causation.
40. Constant conjunctions tip us off to continuities (causal mechanisms), but the mechanism is the sine qua non of causality.
41. Empiricist philosophers deny that anything makes anything happen because they are blind to anything not depicted or a depiction.
42. We first know what causes what; only then do we look for regularities.

CAUSALITY AND SPACE-TIME
------------------------
43. Hume assumes that precedence in time and adjacency in space can be understood in non-causal terms—this assumption is false.
44. A given event's space-time location is constituted by its causal relations to other events.
45. There is no non-relational way of understanding space-time position.
46. The "Hume world" thought experiment fails because any instance of persistence or occupancy is an instance of causation.
47. Spatiotemporal changes are causal changes.
48. Notions such as displacement and occupancy are to be understood in causal terms.
49. There can be no spatiotemporal changes without causal changes.
50. What grounds saying an object has moved is a statement about what would-be occupants must do to occupy that place.

HUME'S ERROR: FACTS VS. TRUTHS
------------------------------
51. Hume's analysis is false because it makes a false assumption: that changes consist of discrete events.
52. The spatiotemporal world obviously undergoes change, but such events differ from those described by scientific or everyday statements.
53. The world doesn't consist of truths; it consists of facts. Truths hold in virtue of facts but aren't identical with them.
54. Events are nominalizations of truths, not constituents of the external world.
55. A pig falling and splattering cannot be atomized into a sequence of discrete events.
56. The redistributions of mass-energy that constitute change do not have a digital structure.
57. The world has an analogue, not a digital structure.
58. Observation represents mass-energy displacement as seamless, not as consisting of discrete parts.
59. We know we are witnessing causation because we know we are witnessing continuity.
60. Articulations in our beliefs about the world should not be identified with articulations in the world itself.

TRANSCENDENTAL ARGUMENT FOR CAUSATION
-------------------------------------
61. A transcendental argument for P shows that unless P were true, it couldn't even be asked whether P were true.
62. Genidentical thought-episodes (causally related mental phases) demonstrate that things make other things happen.
63. For the mind to persist, its states at different times must be causally related.
64. If state Bt isn't responsible for state Bt*, there's no ground for saying both constitute one persisting entity.
65. Empiricism is incoherent: questions about interpreting observations must be settled before observational data can be logged.
66. Empirical reportage necessarily embodies non-empirical, meta-observational assumptions.
67. There is no such thing as a conceptually innocent observation-report.
68. If observation-reports were purged of theoretical commitments, they would be stilted and useless.

THE SELF AND PERSONAL IDENTITY
------------------------------
69. Hume's introspection-based argument that there is no self fails to distinguish the observer from what is observed.
70. Hume found only perceptions when introspecting because he was looking at perceptions, not at himself looking.
71. It isn't because two mental segments belong to the same mind that they constitute one thought process—it's the reverse.
72. Because segments constitute one unbroken thought-process, they belong to the same mind.
73. The self endures by virtue of cohesion-relations among the particulars it hosts.
74. The self has cohesion-relations to thank for its existence, not vice versa.
75. What unites pre-freeze and post-freeze brain states (in cryogenics) is persistence of a single structure mediating ideation.
76. The self consists of awareness-mediating enduring structures underlying mental activity.

SYSTEM ORGANIZATION AND MENTAL STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------
77. It is possible for all constituents of a system to fall within its scope (like citizens in a democracy).
78. Systems can be organized horizontally (separation into strata) or vertically (structures coordinating strata).
79. Even dictators need cooperation from those they govern, so they fall within the scope of their system.
80. Mental constituents need not be renegade structures outside systemic pressures.

DEDUCTIVE-NOMOLOGICAL (DN) MODEL CRITIQUE
-----------------------------------------
81. DN analysis of explanation: to explain event O is to identify laws such that O logically follows from those laws plus O's antecedents.
82. DN fails because any event is a logical consequence of infinitely many universal generalizations, most of which are not explanatory.
83. Non-nomic generalizations (like "every writing utensil on JM's desk is red") don't support counterfactuals and aren't explanatory.
84. Natural laws support counterfactuals; non-nomic generalizations do not.
85. We can distinguish natural laws from non-nomic generalizations only because we have prior knowledge of causes—making DN circular.
86. Counterfactuals describe causal laws governing the world, not events in other realities.
87. Showing something instantiates a regularity merely identifies a class of events we can't explain.
88. Regularities are shadows cast by underlying causal mechanisms.
89. Regularities tell us where to look for causes but are not themselves explanatory.

PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPLANATION
-------------------------
90. Psychology explains by rationalizing, but this doesn't make it fundamentally different from physics.
91. Both psychology and physics seek causal mechanisms; in psychology, these often take the form of rational motivations.
92. Psychological explanations rarely satisfy DN because psychological sequences seldom instantiate exceptionless regularities.
93. DN is incompatible with the datum that explanations citing motives have genuine explanatory value.
94. The Menendez brothers' explanation (wanting inheritance, lacking moral scruples) has explanatory value despite not citing exceptionless laws.
95. A person's being unscrupulous and about to be disinherited doesn't make it more likely than not that he'll kill his parents—yet this can still explain patricide.
96. DN* (requiring only >50% probability) fails for the same reasons as DN.
97. Many true explanations involve antecedents that make the explained event less than 50% likely.
98. It is neither necessary nor helpful to cite uniformities when explaining actions via beliefs and desires.
99. Knowing Bill fears Hell is a complete explanation for his church attendance; citing "all pious people go to Church" adds nothing.
100. Piety might be a concomitant of the actual cause rather than the cause itself—regularities can mislead about causation.

POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY (Part 5)
===================================================================================

MULTIPLE REALIZABILITY AND EXPLANATION
---------------------------------------
1. Two architecturally identical houses can fall for the same reason despite having completely different microphysical structures in their components.
2. Mechanical (Newtonian, macro-level) laws can be the same in two cases even when implemented by completely different microconstituents.
3. It is wrong to say that the laws compelling the collapse of two houses differed just because their microstructures differed—this would make the shared outcome a mere coincidence.
4. The same laws can be involved in different cases while being implemented by different microphysical mechanisms.
5. Most laws hold only probabilistically; two Newtonian-identical situations could have different outcomes due to quantum events.
6. Newtonian laws don't provide 100% guarantees because quantum events can over-ramify.
7. If we required causes to operate with 100% efficacy, we would make it impossible to produce meaningful explanatory generalizations.
8. Structural (non-microphysical) defects can be genuine causes even though such defects don't always lead to the same outcomes.
9. The a priori belief that effects couldn't have failed to occur given their causes must be jettisoned because it is inimical to explanation.

PROBABILISTIC CAUSATION
-----------------------
10. Smoking causes cancer even though less than 30% of smokers get lung cancer.
11. Principled regularities have all the explanatory virtues that laws are supposed to have and might as well be identified with laws.
12. E1 can be the cause of E2 even though events relevantly like E1 are unlikely to bring about events relevantly like E2.
13. Epistemically speaking, there is such a thing as probabilistic causation—whether there is ontologically is a separate question.
14. The orthodoxy that ontologically there is probabilistic causation is distinct from the epistemic claim.
15. Von Neumann's proof about hidden variables established only that quantum physics could not be made epistemically deterministic, leaving open whether it could be ontologically deterministic.

FACTS, PROPOSITIONS, AND EXPLANATION
-------------------------------------
16. Scientific explanations justify events and must show those events to comply with natural laws.
17. Justification is a relationship that holds between propositions, not between facts.
18. Facts don't bear on other things in a logical or confirmational sense—they obviously do so causally.
19. Propositions consist of concepts; facts consist of objects and instances of first-order concepts.
20. A non-analytic proposition is a conceptualization or propositionalization of a given fact.
21. A given fact admits of indefinitely many propositionalizations.
22. The mass-energy displacements constitutive of walking across a room are necessary and sufficient for atomic, chemical, physiological, and psychological propositions.
23. Two propositions can hold in virtue of the same fact yet have no explanatory bearing on each other.
24. For each psychological truth, there may be a corresponding biochemical truth, but the latter isn't explanatorily relevant to the former.

DATA-MODELING AND SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES
-----------------------------------------
25. Scientific disciplines' first objective must be to model data, since it is only through data that truths can be known.
26. There must be a way of evaluating the fitness of a model without knowing whether it is true.
27. To model propositions is to systematize them so that their bearing-relations on one another are identified and appropriately organized.
28. Propositions about facts are exceedingly crude representations of those facts.
29. Propositions consist of tendentious conceptualizations—inquiry-driven over-consideration of certain aspects and under-consideration of others.
30. It is inherent in what propositions are that they leave out facts, including causally relevant ones.
31. The generalizations constitutive of disciplines are constructed of concepts that by their very nature leave out causally relevant factors.

CRITIQUE OF BEHAVIORISM
-----------------------
32. Behaviorism is false—surely nobody ever actually thought otherwise.
33. Many scholars felt forced to advocate behaviorism despite personal reservations because they accepted that mental states qua private entities are not fit objects for science.
34. Behaviorists accepted that all sciences are either identical with physics or watered-down versions of physics.
35. Behaviorists accepted the Deductive-Nomological (DN) model as correct.
36. The behaviorist's publicity-criterion ("don't believe if it can't be publicized") presupposes the existence of the mental it purports to deny.
37. The behaviorist's maxim exists as a bulwark against insanity and fraud, thus presupposing mental states.
38. To the extent mental entities exist, behaviorists hold they are identical with dispositions to engage in overt behaviors—this is false.
39. Language dispositions according to behaviorism must be purely reflexive like knee jerks—this is untenable.
40. Behaviorists must conclude language is acquired through operant conditioning—this is false.

CHOMSKY'S CRITIQUE OF BEHAVIORISM
---------------------------------
41. If behaviorism were true, hearing "how are you doing?" would cause one to reflexively bark out "very well, thank you"—but this isn't so.
42. We understand and produce expressions we've never or rarely heard, instantly and without hesitation.
43. It isn't through operant conditioning that language is learned.
44. Responses to linguistic stimuli embody cognitive mechanisms not acquired through experience.
45. Pre-experiential cognitive mechanisms mediate principle-driven behavior that can't be understood in terms of perceptual experience specificities.
46. "Pre-experiential" doesn't mean "inborn"—structures subserving cognitive functions could come into existence post-utero.
47. The syntactic rule governing words like "since" is extremely intricate, yet a child needs to hear it only once or twice to use it correctly.
48. There is no way to operantly condition a person to use complex syntactic words correctly.

FUNCTIONALISM AND ITS PROBLEMS
------------------------------
49. How a person reacts to a stimulus is a function of both the stimulus nature and what is in that person's mind.
50. Attempts to reduce mental states to overt behaviors end up reducing them to behaviors plus mental states—what was supposed to be reduced hasn't been.
51. Functionalism is the doctrine that it is solely in virtue of what x's causes and effects are that x falls into mental type M.
52. It was wrongly taken for granted that functionalism is not identical with behaviorism.
53. Lewisian functionalism attempts to "Ramsify out" all mention of mental entities in describing non-mental causes and effects.
54. There are infinitely many possible reasons why one might utter any given sentence.
55. There is no finite list of stimuli that could lead one to utter any given sentence.
56. The lists of possible causes and effects of mental states are not finite and must be identified intensionally.
57. Intensional definitions of mental state causes/effects are loaded with the very mentalistic terms functionalism seeks to eliminate.
58. The Ramsey-Lewis sentence is a surd—no such sentence exists because recursive definitions needed are loaded with mentalistic terms.
59. If Lewisian functionalism is right, mental states do nothing—they are epiphenomenal.
60. It isn't in virtue of being an intention to become a lawyer that x leads its host to take the LSAT; rather, doing so qualifies it as that intention.

PSYCHOLOGY VS. PHYSICS: IRREDUCIBILITY
--------------------------------------
61. No body of psychological data coincides with any body of physical data.
62. Physical scientists model the same truths in different ways, but psychological data doesn't even overlap with physical data.
63. Epistemically speaking, facts modeled by psychology don't overlap with facts modeled by physics.
64. It's the epistemic sense of "fact" that's operative since facts are science-relevant only to the extent they are knowable.
65. Physics and physiology can be reconciled because both are theoretical superstructures converging on one set of facts.
66. Psychology and physics don't converge on any one set of facts—what they're studying differs epistemically.
67. Larry throwing furniture is a datum for physics, not psychology; for psychology, it's a significant truth contingent on psychological causes.
68. If Larry were a zombie or robot, his furniture-throwing would cease to be of concern to psychology.
69. Psychology is irreducible to physics both in the generic sense (as biology is) and in a special sense unique to psychology.
70. The functionalist cannot coherently distinguish his position from behaviorism.

EMPIRICISM AND ITS INCOHERENCE
------------------------------
71. It is a datum that there are psychological data—denying this is unscientific.
72. A scientist's suspicion that there is no physics-friendly way to model psychological data is not a good reason to deny such data.
73. The belief that physics is the only legitimate discipline is a priori and therefore non-empirical—ironically, this is an embodiment of empiricism.
74. Knowledge of one's own mind is empirical but not in a way that validates empiricism.
75. It's unempirical to turn a blind eye to psychological data, yet Dennett and Churchland do so to be true to empiricism.
76. All data is as theory-heavy as psychological data; one couldn't describe perception without assuming many theories.
77. If Dennett and Churchland are right about psychological data, they must also deny perceptual data are genuine data.
78. Because they are empiricists, Dennett and Churchland cannot be coherent without being incoherent.
79. Empiricism entails behaviorism; behaviorism is false; therefore empiricism is false.

PERCEPTION AND INNATE KNOWLEDGE
-------------------------------
80. The behaviorist wrongly assumes that a being devoid of cognitive structure can have sense-perceptions.
81. Photon-induced disturbances that elicit perceptions from you would elicit nothing from a rock.
82. The class of stimuli that would elicit accurate perceptions is infinitely large and infinitely varied.
83. There is no strictly physiological characterization of any mental property.
84. There is no physiological characterization of the psychological differences between instances of different psychological properties.
85. Mechanisms linking perceptual causes to effects must be understood in psychological terms.
86. Perception leads to knowledge; perceptual mechanisms mediate ideation embodying sensitivity to relations of justification.
87. The knowledge embodied in perceptual mechanisms cannot itself be acquired through sense-perception.
88. Pre-experiential knowledge cannot result from operant conditioning.

HEMPEL'S ANALYSIS OF REDUCTION
------------------------------
89. Hempel held that the question "can psychology be absorbed into physiology?" is strictly empirical—this is wrong.
90. Hempel believed reducing D to D* means demonstrating any D-concept is co-extensive with some D*-concept.
91. Co-extensiveness of concepts does not entail that one discipline can be absorbed into another.
92. If there is any truth that D can say that D* cannot, D cannot be absorbed into D*.
93. Science has one objective: to produce an accurate and complete description of reality.
94. Hempel was wrong to hold that D can be absorbed into D* if any D-concept is co-extensive with some D*-concept.
95. Hempel believed erroneously because empiricism made him so.

MULTIPLE REALIZABILITY AND PHYSIOLOGICAL LAWS
---------------------------------------------
96. Physiological properties are multiply realizable—a given property phi is multiply realizable insofar as it is physiological.
97. There cannot be physiological truths unless there are physiological laws.
98. An organism is a structure consisting of reliably functioning biological parts—this requires laws.
99. There is no conceivable universe in which physicalism (every physiological property is identical to some microphysical property) is true.
100. The statue isn't identical with the clay of which it is composed—destroying the statue needn't destroy the clay.

POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY (Part 6)
===================================================================================

MULTIPLE REALIZABILITY AND REDUCTION
-------------------------------------
1. A thing's being made of glass might disqualify it from being a liver in our universe, but this doesn't mean no creature could have a glass liver.
2. Given only that certain microphysical properties rule out being a liver, it doesn't follow that some microphysical property is required for being a liver.
3. There may be infinitely many distinct microstructures that a liver can have.
4. No physiological property can be co-extensive with any microphysical property.
5. A psi-instance x can be identical with something that constitutes a phi-instance y, but x itself cannot be identical with y itself.
6. D can be reduced to D* if and only if there neither is nor can be any D-truth that isn't equivalent with some D*-truth.
7. Philosophers have embraced absurd analyses (like Hempel's) because they were blind to the distinction between RF-meaning and MG-meaning.
8. Coextensive properties are coextensive, but coextensive* properties (involving material constitution) aren't necessarily coextensive.
9. Two microphysically identical situations cannot be macrophysically different—the macrophysical supervenes on the microphysical.
10. If any macro-property being coextensive with a micro-property is nothing but an accident, it has no explanatory value.

NOMIC STRUCTURE AND EXPLANATION
-------------------------------
11. The fact that in world W each physiological property is coextensive* with some microphysical property obscures W's nomic structure.
12. In W, beings like us would be disposed to misidentify the laws of physiology in their universe.
13. Even if it isn't an accident that the physiological tracks the microphysical, there's a sense in which it is accidental—and that's the sense relevant to reduction.
14. If D is reducible to D*, it's not enough that D-phenomena can be correlated with D*-phenomena; every D-truth must be a logical consequence of some D*-truth.
15. If there is even a single psychological truth not equivalent to any non-psychological truth, then psychology is irreducible to physiology.
16. "Tree" is a natural-kind term—in virtue of being a tree, an object has causal properties it wouldn't otherwise have.
17. It is because of its causal properties that T is a tree, not because of its effects on anyone's ideation.
18. We can know that T is a tree only if its causal properties dispose people to have certain experiences.
19. For non-psychological natural kinds, there can be only a purely circumstantial correlation between having a property and having certain experiences.

MENTAL ENTITIES AND PHYSIOLOGY
------------------------------
20. Supposing x is both physiological and mental, it isn't in virtue of being content-bearing that x is physiological; it is in virtue of being content-bearing that x is mental.
21. It would make no sense to say x's being a desire for world-peace made x a frontal lobe, or vice versa.
22. These statements are analytically true, not empirical.
23. Mental entities can be constituted by physiological entities without psychological properties being reducible to physiological ones.
24. For any psychological property phi, x instantiates phi only if there is some physiological property psi such that m(x) instantiates psi.

DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC TRUTHS
--------------------------
25. In describing a proposition as D-specific, one distinguishes principles D merely employs from principles individuative of D.
26. There are principles of logic all disciplines use that don't belong to any discipline.
27. So far as a logical truth is put to physics-specific use, it assumes a physics-specific form, but that doesn't make it physics-specific.
28. There are discipline-specific logical truths—formal logic isn't identical with logic-proper.
29. Given x's position at t and density at t*, there's no sense in which the latter can be understood in terms of the former without general propositions.
30. Explanation requires supplementing particular facts with general propositions concerning classes of events.

SPACE, METRICS, AND EXPLANATION
-------------------------------
31. If x moves continuously from p to p*, x's occupying p* can be understood in terms of its occupying p.
32. Continuous motion provides the paradigm for understanding how one state explains another.
33. Secondary properties are properties of relations (observer and observed); primary properties are properties of objects.
34. No property of secondary kind can generate a space* coincident with space* generated by primary properties.
35. Given a fixed relation R, redness may be identified with micro-structure and explained in terms of an object's structure.
36. A metric is a definition of congruence—a criterion for determining whether objects have a property to the same degree.
37. We use optical metrics rather than cardiological metrics because the former avoid anomalies.
38. A non-anomalous space* comprises only metric-consistent changes.
39. If one event is disruptive, it leads to a proportionally counter-disruptive event—instances of uniformity are limiting cases.
40. e causes e* if an otherwise ideal metric's invalidity is a logical consequence of e*'s failing to follow e.

HUME'S ANALYSIS AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
------------------------------------
41. Hume's analysis entails that neither event in a causal instance can be understood in terms of the other—each is an accident relative to the other.
42. In identifying causation with correlation, Hume claims that to explain an event is to show it is an accident.
43. "To explain is to fail to explain"—this is the methodological significance of empiricism.
44. Hempel's analysis of interdisciplinary reduction has the same consequence as Hume's analysis of causation.

INDUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION
---------------------------
45. There are two kinds of induction: enumerative and explanatory.
46. Hume's argument against induction doesn't distinguish which kind is being targeted.
47. The Uniformity Principle (UP) bridges future to past and unknown to known, but Hume claims it cannot be justified non-circularly.
48. Assuming the gambler's fallacy shows you can't predict fair coin outcomes from past outcomes—but weighted coins are different.
49. If you see a coin land tails 10,000 times, you'd assume a mechanism disposing it to land tails, and prediction becomes justified.
50. We are justified in positing mechanisms that will continue to operate to the extent the world is explicable.
51. Saying one has no grounds for positing ongoing mechanisms amounts to denying that anomaly-elimination makes hypotheses preferable—an analytically false position.
52. If there is analytic, non-empirical knowledge, we can justify faith in sense perceptions and future predictions.

IDEALISM AND ITS REFUTATION
---------------------------
53. Idealism is the doctrine that objects are identical with one's perceptions of them.
54. If idealism is correct, our "perceptions" have no objects and are just hallucinations.
55. Berkeley and 20th century "neutral monists" held the difference between idealism and realism is one of language—this is false.
56. There is no IL (idealist language) translation of statements involving transperceptual entities like rooms and walking.
57. To describe perceptions of tables and rooms, one must assume such things really exist—thus assuming idealism is false.
58. Idealism predates philosophy; many forms of psychosis involve idealism-like positions; all infants are idealists.
59. Non-psychotic idealism operates within a fundamentally non-idealistic belief-system.
60. "Neutral monism" claims mind and matter are built from perceptions—but perceptions are mental, so this is just Berkeleyan idealism.

BERKELEY'S ARGUMENTS REFUTED
----------------------------
61. Berkeley's argument from perspectival variation fails because it only eliminates absolute properties, not comparative ones.
62. Given perspectival variation, what remains are instances of comparative properties (relations), not absolute properties.
63. Berkeley's "try to conceive an unconceived chicken" is syntactically ambiguous between conceiving a specific chicken and conceiving a proposition.
64. One can accept "there are chickens you aren't thinking of" without thereby thinking of any specific chicken.
65. One can consider true propositions about things (like primes greater than 8,887,777) without thinking of any specific such thing.

PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES AND EMOTIONS
------------------------------------
66. All emotions are beliefs; all affects embody beliefs.
67. Objectual attitudes (admiration, love, hate, envy) consist of propositional attitudes.
68. One's admiration for someone is constituted by, not caused by, one's beliefs about that person.
69. The relationship between beliefs about Smith and admiration for Smith is constitutive, not causal.
70. It is not even theoretically possible to admire someone of whose lack of merit one is completely convinced.
71. There are pure objectual awarenesses (perceptions), but no pure objectual attitudes.
72. To have an attitude toward something is to have a belief about it.
73. Lusting for someone does consist in having certain beliefs—this seems false only because we've internalized erroneous empiricist theories.

THE STRUCTURE OF BELIEF
-----------------------
74. The term "propositional attitude" misleadingly suggests decomposition into awareness of a proposition plus acceptance—this is viciously circular.
75. To say content is causal role is to say content isn't causally responsible—but content obviously is causally responsible.
76. Functionalizing awareness of propositions strips that awareness of causal efficacy; functionalism is therefore false.
77. Sense-perception is predicational—one can't just see the rock; one must see it as having some property.
78. The spatiotemporal world consists of property-instances; there is nothing in which property-instances inhere.
79. Nothing can be propertyless; a propertyless thing wouldn't have spatiotemporal location and thus wouldn't exist.
80. Locke's substrates are surds; instances of things "inhering" in them are equally incoherent.
81. For one to believe P is for P to be presented to one as true, as one sees a rock as gray.

CHURCHLAND'S ELIMINATIVISM REFUTED
----------------------------------
82. Folk psychology is a belief system; its mere existence guarantees there are beliefs, so it verifies itself.
83. Churchland's position is self-undermining: denying beliefs requires having beliefs.
84. Churchland's witch-analogy fails because folk psychology concerns itself (beliefs about beliefs) while witch-theory doesn't concern itself.
85. Folk psychology, being reflexive, cannot be a mere theoretical posit like witches.

EGOCENTRIC VS. DISCURSIVE BELIEFS
---------------------------------
86. There are two kinds of beliefs: egocentric (relativized to self as origin) and discursive (no privileged position).
87. One can have emotionally antiseptic knowledge that one's life has changed—this is discursive belief.
88. Grasping a truth egocentrically ("it's cold where I am now") is identical with having an emotion.
89. Egocentric beliefs almost certainly develop before discursive beliefs.
90. Egocentric beliefs are more central to psychological architecture; discursive beliefs are easily modified.
91. If Einstein came to believe everyone was trying to kill him, his character would change dramatically—unlike discursive belief changes.
92. Propositional attitudes are not actionable except insofar as they give rise to phenomenological episodes.

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS
------------------------------
93. It isn't in virtue of causing one to feel good or bad that an emotion is positive or negative.
94. Positive emotions can cause distress (laughter can trigger asthma); negative emotions can cause relief.
95. Anything can cause anything—the physiological concomitants of positive emotions could precipitate acute distress.
96. Delight at being cured of an ailment consists in recognizing that one's life has thereby improved—a belief.

OLFACTION AND PERCEPTION
------------------------
97. Whether a system mediates genuine olfaction depends on whether it has second-order responses of the right kind.
98. A system doesn't mediate olfaction if it doesn't respond to its first-order responses in ways tracking olfaction-specific properties.
99. Olfaction picks up on biology-relevant (survival- and health-relevant) properties: rottenness, wholesomeness, etc.
100. To endow a system with olfaction, you must sensitize it to principles mediating between microphysical and olfactory properties.

POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY (Part 7)
===================================================================================

DESIRES AS BELIEFS
------------------
1. A desire to eat cake is identical with a judgment that eating it would be pleasurable.
2. One doesn't have a desire to alleviate an unpleasant state without a belief about what action will alleviate it.
3. If one has a belief about how to achieve gratification, one has the corresponding desire.
4. Desires don't cease to exist when they are outweighed by stronger desires.
5. One can want to keep one's money while also intending to give it to a gunman—the intention isn't the same as wanting.
6. The victim of armed robbery doesn't want to give up his money; he judges it necessary for survival.

INTENTIONS VS. DESIRES
----------------------
7. Intentions are not desires—empiricists wrongly think otherwise.
8. Davidson's view that one's intention is identical with one's strongest desire is false.
9. Wanting to live doesn't mean wanting to do all things involved in staying alive.
10. Someone may need amputation to live but doesn't want to lose their leg—they want to live.
11. The intention to give money to a gunman is a judgment about being better off, not a desire.
12. Many so-called higher-order desires (HODs) are really judgments, not desires.
13. Refraining from insulting one's supervisor is judgment-driven, not desire-driven.
14. The intention is a judgment concerning one's desires; it is not itself a desire.

OBJECT-AWARENESS AND PROPOSITION-AWARENESS
-------------------------------------------
15. All truth-aware creatures are object-aware, but not all object-aware creatures are truth-aware.
16. Merely object-aware creatures (MOCs) can be distinguished from proposition-aware creatures (PACs).
17. For MOCs, survival is bodily survival; the same is initially true for neophyte PACs.
18. With second-order desires comes a cleavage within the mind: conflict between what one wants and what one wants to want.
19. With each installment of nth-order desires (n≥2), desires become less directly concerned with bodily survival.

THE SUPERSTRUCTURE OF AGENCY
----------------------------
20. As psychological superstructure grows, bodily survival becomes more dependent on the superstructure's integrity.
21. Higher organisms require more sophisticated cognitive machinery to carry out even simple operations.
22. A reversal occurs: initially superstructure existed for the body; now the body exists for the superstructure.
23. Initially higher-order desire gratification served first-order desires; now first-order desires serve higher-order ones.
24. Bach's music appeals directly to rationality-based desires; Jagger's appeals directly to sexuality-based desires.
25. Rationality is seen as intrinsically valuable because agency depends on rational operations.
26. One's agency is identical with one's self; one acts (rather than reacts) only to the extent behavior is guided by superstructure-specific desires.

VALUES AND AGENCY
-----------------
27. To value something is to see it as conducive to consolidating or enlarging one's agency.
28. Reading Mill is valued over Harlequin romances because it hones the mind and fortifies agency.
29. Even altruistic values serve the valuer's agency—Mother Teresa's values made altruism in her self-interest.
30. Authentic moral reactions can be expressions of basal, value-free survival instincts.
31. People's senses of right and wrong are evolutionarily important—without them, we'd be at each other's throats.
32. Morality is weak relative to self-interest but strong in absolute terms, like gravity.

HEDONISTIC VS. ACCOMPLISHMENT-BASED PLEASURE
---------------------------------------------
33. Hedonistic pleasure is value-free pleasure; accomplishment-based pleasure is not hedonistic.
34. Solving a math problem is accomplishment-based pleasure; shooting heroin is hedonistic pleasure.
35. The object of desire is gratification; the object of intention is not always gratification.
36. A judgment to write a treatise isn't a desire—it's a judgment about living according to values.
37. Such judgments become desire-like; skilled craftsmen look forward to their tasks with excitement.

MIND, BODY, AND ATHLETIC ABILITY
--------------------------------
38. We see our minds as intrinsically good, not merely instrumentally valuable.
39. Michael Jordan rightly sees athletic ability as a characteristic of his self, not just his body.
40. If Jordan woke in another body, he'd be troubled only if it couldn't do what validated his self-concept.
41. Athletic ability is cognitive, not somatic—being coordinated means one's mind governs the body intelligently.
42. Many athletic characteristics (knowing when to pass) are comparable to strategic military decisions.
43. Even speed is largely cognitive in nature.

INTELLECTUALIZATION AND NEUROSIS
--------------------------------
44. We engage in actions believed to undermine agency only because rationalization makes us believe otherwise.
45. Intellectualization is peculiar among neurotic defenses—those who engage in it come out ahead.
46. Intellectualization blunts emotional acuity but more than compensates with theoretical acuity.
47. Intellectualization inhibits rather than destroys emotional acuity—the blunting is easily reversed.
48. The intellectual is often hyper-aware of others' feelings but regards them significant only when aligned with impersonal standards.
49. Accusations that intellectuals are obtuse often project the accuser's own viciousness onto the intellectual.
50. Some neurosis is an inevitable concomitant and necessary ingredient of extreme achievement.

FIRST-ORDER AND HIGHER-ORDER DESIRES
-------------------------------------
51. Sometimes first-order desires must be given free reign; emotional non-paralytics inevitably seem wanton occasionally.
52. A person who can indulge only first-order desires is degenerate; one who cannot indulge them is a robot.
53. First-order desires typically cannot and should not be extinguished—they're indispensable to psychological vitality.
54. When first-order desires are over-marginalized, the person regresses to sociopathy—they no longer have a soul.
55. A person whose first-order desires are destroyed has been over-acculturated out of existence.

BELIEFS VS. INSTINCTS
---------------------
56. A "belief" that persists regardless of experience is no belief at all—it's an instinct.
57. Instincts are experience-insensitive; beliefs are experience-sensitive and displace one another.
58. Even prejudiced people, given enough information, will modify beliefs; dogs at racetracks show compulsive, unmodifiable behavior.
59. Dogs are trained, not taught; training bypasses intelligence and creates reflexes.
60. Operant conditioning isn't teaching—one set of reflexes replaces another without judgment.
61. Instincts themselves don't change; only whether they're operative changes.
62. MOCs can be trained, not taught; teaching involves transmission of truths.

IMPLICIT THOUGHT REJECTED
-------------------------
63. Authors who use "implicit thought" non-equivocally mean "non-thought."
64. An "implicit thought" is one a creature didn't have but that would have justified its behavior.
65. "Implicit thought" should be extruded from scientific discourse since it means nothing or "non-thought."

DESIRE HIERARCHIES
------------------
66. A belief about how desires should be organized is itself a desire—a second-order desire.
67. Each person's desire-hierarchy undergoes many permutations over time.
68. People have third-order desires: desires about their desires about their first-order desires.
69. Values are intentions become habitual; desires, once habitual, become values.

SUICIDE AND AGENCY
------------------
70. People who unsuccessfully attempt suicide are typically in a very different psychological category from those who succeed.
71. Genuine suicides may be compatible with the view that intentions are judgments about preserving agency.

AESTHETIC AND MORAL NIHILISM
----------------------------
72. Aesthetic nihilism: no work of art is better than any other.
73. Moral nihilism: no act is better or worse than any other.
74. Musical nihilism equals musical relativism—if all noise is music, no music has value.
75. One is an empiricist if one believes moral ideation is non-judicative sentiment; a rationalist otherwise.
76. Setting aside psychopaths, people's responses show their real views are that some acts are wrong and some music good.

HUME'S MORAL SENTIMENTALISM
---------------------------
77. Hume held that if moral statements express emotions, they express sentiments rather than beliefs.
78. Hume assumed if a reaction is emotional, it fails to embody a belief—this is wrong.
79. If empiricism is correct, emotions are non-cognitive; but empiricism is incorrect.
80. Emotions, though beliefs, are not discursive beliefs—they are fundamentally egocentric.
81. Moral sentiments always have indirect bearing on one's own welfare, even when about long-gone dictators.

MORAL SUPERVENIENCE
-------------------
82. There are no moral differences without descriptive differences—the moral supervenes on the descriptive.
83. Moral intuitions track descriptive truths; moral truths hold in virtue of the same facts as descriptive truths.
84. Morally good acts invariably conduce to psychological, biological, or psychobiological welfare.
85. One can derive "ought" from "is"—Moore and Hume were wrong to deny this.
86. P entailing Q doesn't mean there's nothing in Q not in P; (2)-(5) are reconceptualizations of (1)'s content.

EGOCENTRIC VS. DISCURSIVE KNOWLEDGE
------------------------------------
87. A truth can be located in an egocentric, self-specific map or in an objective, person-non-specific map.
88. Knowing egocentrically that one's wife could kill one doesn't give rise to fear; it is fear.
89. Action-dispositive "feelings" are beliefs that locate propositions in egocentric cognitive maps.
90. The empiricist, abhorring unconscious structure, must say emotional phenomenology is just phenomenology—but this is implausible.
91. Subtle situational changes produce equally subtle phenomenological changes in reactions.
92. Intuitions track an unbounded class of facts; there must be principled connections between facts and intuitions.

INTUITION AND SUCCESS
---------------------
93. Most of our knowledge is intuition-based; most judgments are justified by subsequent intellectual developments.
94. Successful pianists, writers, and scientists learn to go with gut feelings; failures are hobbled by discursive judgments.
95. A person's muse speaks through intuitions—gut feelings for which one cannot find rational basis at the time.
96. "Writer's block" afflicts pedants who won't write without clearance from internal authorities.

AESTHETIC REALISM
-----------------
97. Art cannot be observed; paint is seen but paintings aren't paint; noises are heard but music isn't noise.
98. A hawk sees paint better than any person but will never see the painting in the paint.
99. An artistically intelligent person with poor vision sees art better than an unintelligent person with good vision.
100. Mozart and Bach were obviously better composers than many others—obvious to anyone with a musical bone in their body.

POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY (Part 8)
===================================================================================

RATIONALITY VS. INTELLIGENCE
-----------------------------
1. Rationality is personal, as opposed to subpersonal, intelligence deployed in ways advantageous to oneself.
2. Dogs' minds are replete with intelligence at the subpersonal level, but Rover per se is not very intelligent.
3. Personal ideation can be intelligent but not rational (e.g., the mad scientist building a monster to win affection).
4. Dogs aren't irrational—irrationality is corrupted rationality and thus a prerogative of rational beings.
5. Dogs are sub-rational; their being sub-rational consists in their minds being incapable of personal thought, not thought tout court.

PERSONAL AND SUBPERSONAL MENTATION
-----------------------------------
6. What transfers intelligence from subpersonal to personal mentation involves phenomenologization.
7. The nucleus of the personal stratum is consciousness; the essence of consciousness is phenomenology.
8. Even our own propositional attitudes are knowable only to the extent that they are phenomenologized.
9. Repressed propositional attitudes are not intrinsically different from unrepressed ones—the difference is location in the mind.
10. Consciousness qua consciousness is not intelligent; it mediates only picture-thought, the lowest form of thought.
11. Picture-thought isn't thought at all—thoughts are judgments, and pictures aren't judgments.
12. The subpersonal is inherently intelligent; whatever intelligence exists in the personal stratum is bequeathed by the subpersonal.
13. By "musicalizing" subpersonal processes, we make them perceptible and endow consciousness with acuity it otherwise lacks.

KNOWLEDGE AND SURVIVAL
----------------------
14. The delight we take in music is a form of the delight we take in acquiring knowledge.
15. People are identical with their minds; one is only as big as one's mind.
16. The delight in knowledge acquisition is a derivative of our survival-instinct, remodeled to fit rationality-mediated integrations.
17. For creatures with selves, bodily well-being is but an instrument for the self's well-being.
18. It is an intrinsic good to see and absorb hitherto unobservable thought-processes into one's agency.

PERSONAL MENTATION AND RULES
----------------------------
19. Personal mentation becomes ratiocinative when it becomes rule-governed.
20. Personal mentation comprises sensations and pictures, neither of which can mediate rational thought.
21. Conscious, icon-mediated ideation truly duplicates subpersonal mentation only when it is rule-governed.
22. When customs give way to meta-customs, customs convert into rules.
23. Conscious ideation isn't hewed to subpersonal mentation until it is rule-governed.

MIND VS. SELF
-------------
24. A clear distinction must be drawn between mind and self.
25. Once that distinction is drawn, it becomes clear what makes human beings different from animals.
26. It becomes clear how rationality differs from intelligence and how rationality equals agency.

PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------------
27. Some psychopathologies target one's psychological architecture itself, unlike OCD or schizophrenia.
28. The obsessive-compulsive's architecture is overly intact; its inelasticity manifests as obsessions and compulsions.
29. The schizophrenic's mind is in disarray, but he is still the same person—after medication, he returns.
30. Certain disorders involve dismantling the very structure of the psyche, not just disorganizing its contents.

LANGUAGE AND RATIONALITY
------------------------
31. The claim that linguistic competence constitutes one's ability to grasp non-spatiotemporal entities is untenable.
32. A language is a set of semantic rules assigning meanings to expressions.
33. Semantic rules are propositions; to use "David Bowie" linguistically, one must grasp the proposition that it refers to David Bowie.
34. Rationality is "emotionally integrated" intelligence about one's own welfare.
35. Language-comprehension is mediated by subpersonal processes—understanding is automatic but thought-mediated.
36. The relevant thought-processes were unconscious in the impersonal, Chomskyan sense, not the personal, Freudian sense.
37. Linguistic competence isn't what constitutes rationality (contra Wittgenstein, Davidson, McDowell).

LANGUAGE AS FACILITATOR
-----------------------
38. Linguistic competence enormously facilitates thought.
39. Linguistic competence is a sine qua non for rationality except of the most rudimentary kind.
40. Rationality precedes linguistic competence—there is pre-linguistic rationality.
41. Rationality is personalized intelligence transferred from subpersonal to personal mentation.
42. Consciousness, being phenomenology, represents through depictions: pictures broadly construed.

THOUGHTS AND PICTURES
---------------------
43. It isn't by associating thoughts with pictures that we verbalize them; it's by turning thoughts into pictures of expressions.
44. Languages enable expression because a function assigns distinct expressions to content-distinct thoughts.
45. A function must assign structurally distinct expressions to structurally distinct thoughts.

BELIEFS AND OBSERVABILITY
-------------------------
46. Beliefs per se are unobservable, but their symbolic expressions are observable.
47. Once beliefs are observable via expressions, they become evaluable—they can be objects of awareness.
48. Propositional attitudes become observable only because they become associated with expressions and mental icons.

CUSTOMS VS. RULES
-----------------
49. Customs are not rules—a custom-breaker's peers may react, but their reaction is emotion-based and ad hoc.
50. Rules are never implicit; they must be stated explicitly or be logical consequences of explicit rules.
51. Acting contrary to customs isn't wrong in the same sense as violating rules—merely customary behavior isn't wrong.
52. Deviations from customs become wrong when the customs themselves come to be regulated by customs.
53. When meta-customs come into existence, first-order customs become rules and cease to be customs.

PROTO-EXPRESSIONS AND LANGUAGE EMERGENCE
-----------------------------------------
54. Paradoxically, complex expressions and simple ones come into existence simultaneously.
55. Proto-expressions become real expressions only when higher-order symbols come into existence.
56. There are no genuine expressions until there are higher-order expressions.
57. There are no atomic sentences until there are molecular sentences; no subsentential expressions until there are sentences.
58. Languages can come into existence because "x is a proper part of y" has logical, not chronological meaning.
59. Your lower intestine is a part of your metabolism functionally, not merely spatially.
60. It is by virtue of causal relations, not location, that your heart is part of your body.

SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS AND MISUNDERSTANDING
---------------------------------------
61. Simple expressions of a language cannot be universally misunderstood—when they are, language-shift occurs.
62. Complex expressions can be misunderstood even when their simple constituents are understood.
63. One could grasp the semantics of "function," "class," "number" without knowing complex theorems' meanings or truth-values.

OBSERVABILITY AND PROPOSITIONAL ATTITUDES
------------------------------------------
64. What is observable is what can be represented phenomenologically and therefore iconically.
65. Propositional attitudes are not to any degree constituted by phenomenology.
66. Propositional attitudes have propositions as objects, and propositions cannot be depicted since they are non-spatiotemporal.

NORMS AND VALUES
----------------
67. When personal thought becomes norm-driven, it becomes value-driven.
68. To value something is to see it as norm-compliant—as an instance of how things should be.
69. The ur-value underlying all values is that we should value the extension and consolidation of agency.
70. Human beings have values—this distinguishes us from other sentient beings.
71. The one thing with intrinsic moral value is consolidating and expanding one's own agency; socio-ethical goodness is instrumental.
72. Nietzsche and Spinoza advocated ethical egoism; the author agrees with them.

DESIRES AND RATIONALITY
-----------------------
73. First there are urges, replaced by first-order desires—this constitutes the advent of reason-driven behavior.
74. First-order desires come to be replaced by higher-order desires until the mind becomes "top-heavy."
75. Instinct-influenced, intention-driven behavior is judgment-driven, not urge-driven.
76. Acts we describe as "reactive" or "instinctual" are really judgment-driven but with corrupted judgment.
77. A dog's instinctive attack isn't irrational—only rational or rationality-capable creatures can be irrational.
78. Dogs are not insane; insanity presupposes rationality.

PSYCHOPATHOLOGY: OCD AND SCHIZOPHRENIA
--------------------------------------
79. Whether one becomes schizoaffective vs. OCD may depend on brain-structure, but that doesn't make the disorder purely organic.
80. OCD is to be understood in psychodynamic terms; it has physiological underpinnings like any belief.
81. Even if schizoaffective disorder has a purely organic basis, distinctively schizoaffective ideation must be understood psychodynamically.
82. The schizophrenic's delusions turn painful realities into painful nightmares from which one wakes.
83. Brain-damage leads to misguided ideation not understandable psychodynamically—it interrupts mental activity.
84. In organic disorders, distinct mental faculties are under-interrelated; in psychosis, they are over-interrelated.
85. The psychotic's erratic mentation results from mental processes interrupting and corrupting each other.
86. The Alzheimer's patient's mentation results from processes petering out before converging.

INTERNAL CONFLICT
-----------------
87. Internal conflict is essential to the human condition or virtually inevitable with a human psychological architecture.
88. One can be conflicted by having two conflicting values or by having a value conflicting with a non-value desire.
89. Type-(i) conflict leads to repression only if one turns a blind eye; otherwise it leads to garden-variety unhappiness.
90. Freud said psychoanalytic therapy's purpose was to turn neurotic unhappiness into non-neurotic unhappiness.
91. Type-(i) conflict can lead to growth—one may sacrifice a lesser value to develop a greater one.

RATIONALIZATION
---------------
92. Rationalizing is not lying; lying misrepresents truth to others, rationalizing suppresses one's own knowledge.
93. Rationalization involves lying to oneself and inventing a story to make the lie believable.
94. "No fraud without a fairy tale"—this goes double for frauds perpetrated on oneself.
95. The essence of rationalization is decontextualization—isolating information that would otherwise reveal unwanted truths.
96. If the rationalizer doesn't view things narrowly, he'll be forced to draw unwelcome conclusions.

NEUROSIS AND PSYCHOSIS
----------------------
97. Neurotic people see external reality as it is; it is their own feelings to which they are blind.
98. Psychosis is a psychological illness whose symptoms can be understood in psychological terms.
99. Organic disorders' psychological disruptions are not ameliorated by eliminating intrapsychic conflicts.
100. In dreams, maturation-based inhibitions relax, liberating infantile mental contents from the unconscious.

POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY (Part 9)
===================================================================================

DELUSIONS AND BELIEF
--------------------
1. To have a delusion isn't to have a wrong belief; it is to have a belief that is right in the wrong way.
2. A delusion is to have a belief whose vehicle is some infantile, and therefore false, belief.
3. Beliefs themselves, even delusive ones, don't consist of activity but of activity-mediating structures.
4. Hallucinations, so far as rooted in delusions, are phenomenologicizations of beliefs, not themselves beliefs.
5. Brown believing Mary is a witch is having the right belief (Mary is malicious) but in the wrong way.
6. Even when symptomatic, the schizophrenic also has correct beliefs in the right, antiseptic, discursive way.

REGRESSION AND PSYCHOSIS
------------------------
7. During psychotic episodes, one regresses to cognitive infantilism.
8. Such regressions enable one to consciously believe what one really believes.
9. Regressions enable beliefs in a form where, if taken literally, they are so brazenly wrong they threaten no one.
10. Brown's delusions, though false by definition, are often obviously transformations of non-delusive beliefs.
11. The madman's mind is infantile; the infant's mind paints in black and white, the adult's in pastels.
12. The infant's monochromatic palette results partly from immaturity, partly from not being an arch-rationalizer.
13. Maturation involves implementing repressions; regression involves their removal.
14. To outgrow a belief or desire isn't to cease to have it; it is for it to cease to be operational.

FOLK-PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
------------------------------------
15. Folk-psychology enables rationalization of conscious states to the extent one isn't afflicted by psychopathology.
16. Folk-psychology refers to the totality of platitudes about the psyche accepted by the laity.
17. The schizophrenic's conscious ideation includes things whose existence folk-psychology altogether denies.
18. The position that delusions have a strictly somatic basis is equivalent to saying "that's just how things are."
19. A person's delusions are obviously transformations of correct beliefs; the "crossed wires" view is a non-starter.

PSYCHOSIS AND COMMINGLING
-------------------------
20. Someone dreaming isn't psychotic because the regression to psychological infancy is too clean.
21. Infants aren't psychotic because infantile mentation isn't commingled with more evolved forms.
22. In the psychotic, infantile and non-infantile thought commingle—that's what makes the condition morbid.
23. Infantile thinking is wishful thinking—one sees things as one wants them to be, not as they are.
24. Infantile thinking is incompatible with non-infantile thinking (seeing father as superhuman vs. human).
25. The psychotic must repress non-infantile beliefs to validate wishful, psychotic thinking.

PSYCHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE
-----------------------
26. People aren't disorganized heaps of thought; they are organized, non-heaps of thought.
27. A person's thoughts are organized vertically (hierarchically) and horizontally (by topic/domain).
28. One cannot be healthy if one does no exercise at all, and one cannot be healthy if one exercises 8 hours daily—similarly with psychopathology.
29. A competent psychoanalyst must have experienced some psychopathology but not be a psychological wreck.

MENTAL ILLNESS AND COMPETENCE
-----------------------------
30. To the extent a person is psychologically damaged, he isn't good at anything.
31. If a mentally ill person is a good composer, it's because his psychopathologies haven't corrupted that ability.
32. The experience of mental illness may open artistic and intellectual vistas otherwise closed.
33. One cannot be mentally ill without being blind to some aspect of one's psychological condition.
34. For the same reasons one must know one's own condition, one cannot know another's if blind to one's own.
35. A neurotic has blinded himself to his own desires, which must be discharged as symptoms instead of actions.

PSYCHOPATHS AND INTERNAL CONFLICT
---------------------------------
36. Psychopaths cannot be internally conflicted—they don't have values and therefore don't have conflicting values.
37. The non-psychopath is capable of internal conflict and likely has mixed feelings about situations.
38. The non-psychopath can question the legitimacy of institutional forces; the psychopath cannot grasp legitimacy.
39. Lacking a distinctively human psychological architecture, the psychopath has no conception of forfeiting selfhood.

REPRESSION AND ACTION
---------------------
40. Consciousness won't knowingly cooperate with a repressed emotion; the latter must cloak itself.
41. A repressed emotion is like a non-Marxist government pretending to be Marxist to get Soviet money.
42. When conscious intention is subordinate to unconscious intention, one executes the conscious intention poorly.
43. Unless there's self-discovery, one must rationalize poor performance, altering beliefs, values, and intentions.
44. A certain amount of repression is necessary, but it is by no means innocuous.

UNCONSCIOUS DESIRES VS. INTENTIONS
-----------------------------------
45. Unconscious desires clearly exist; whether unconscious intentions exist is a separate question.
46. Repressed antagonism is expressed through "failures"—forgetting milk, giving away gifts.
47. If conscious of real feelings, one would discharge them through action (divorce); if repressed, through inaction.

OPERATIVE VS. ACTUAL BELIEFS
----------------------------
48. One's operative belief-set can differ from one's actual belief-set.
49. Even though operative beliefs determine behavior, emotions may be hewed to actual (non-operative) beliefs.
50. It's not up to a person what he feels or believes, but it is up to him what he does with those feelings.
51. Deoperationalizing one belief involves deoperationalizing entire networks of propositional attitudes.
52. The subject's psyche must undergo many changes if deoperationalization of a belief is to hold.
53. After a certain point, even if a belief is conscious, the subject won't identify with it—it becomes ego-dystonic.

COMPULSIONS
-----------
54. A compulsion requires being ego-dystonic, opposed to some ego-syntonic belief, yet powerful enough to compel acquiescence.
55. There are two kinds of compulsions: ego-id conflicts and intra-ego conflicts.
56. Addiction-based compulsions result from ego-id conflicts; OCD-based compulsions from intra-ego conflicts.
57. Involuntary behaviors differ from compulsive acts; compulsive acts differ from acts under duress.
58. Mind-internal conflict differs from self-internal conflict.

OCD: HEAD VS. HEART
-------------------
59. The addict's struggle is between egocentric and non-egocentric beliefs about self-interest.
60. The OCD struggle is between two non-egocentric value-systems, each legitimate.
61. OCD is a war between the head and the heart; the heart has right beliefs, the head wrong ones.
62. The heart, doubting the head's legitimacy, takes every opportunity to stymie the head's intentions.
63. The head becomes maniacally dedicated to its plans, unwilling to question any detail.
64. OCD tends to afflict people who are both scrupulous and intellectual.
65. Hyper-morality is a defense against criminal impulses; OCD is a bulwark against unconscious aggression.
66. Because an overly punitive conscience is a sine qua non for OCD, sociopaths cannot have OCD.

NEUROSIS VS. SYSTEMIC DISORDERS
-------------------------------
67. A neurosis is a healthy person's way of pathologizing; a precondition is a structurally intact mind.
68. The neurotic mind is like a car with an improperly installed battery—tiny structural differences, vast functional differences.
69. Vast gains in functionality can be achieved rapidly by those with minor structural problems.
70. Neurosis is system-internal: it inhibits functioning but doesn't corrupt the metabolism itself.
71. Even severe psychosis is system-internal and differs from sociopathy and psychopathy.
72. Sociopathy and psychopathy are not disturbances of integrations but are themselves integrations.
73. With sociopathy/psychopathy, the person has become the disease; the concept of recovery ceases to have meaning.

ANXIETY AND SELF-REMODELING
---------------------------
74. The elimination of anxiety should not be an objective of psychotherapy.
75. The ability to tolerate anxiety should be an objective.
76. One can extirpate anxiety by improving one's life or by self-remodeling to blind oneself to the source.
77. Self-remodeling to blind oneself is identical with sociopathogenesis.

RATIONALIZATION: TWO SENSES
---------------------------
78. To "rationalize" data (scientific sense) is to provide a coherent model, positing unobservables to account for observables.
79. To "rationalize" (pathological sense) is to model data intending to see things as one wants, not as they are.
80. Relative to both senses, to rationalize is to model data.
81. Not all attempts to bury truth are pathological—the mind has limited resources and must sequester some beliefs.
82. Some repression is healthy information-management, not pathology.

TELEOLOGY AND ORGANS
--------------------
83. A blind person's eyes are defective; eyes are supposed to see—this is a datum.
84. What an organ is supposed to do isn't always determined by its owner's objectives.
85. Even if one intends to blind oneself, one's eyes exist to give sight.
86. "O is supposed to do X" means: if O does X, the universe is more intelligible.
87. When we talk about what eyes "should" do, we're talking about the structural integrity of the universe.
88. A world of sick creatures is more entropic than a world of healthy creatures.

CAUSATION AND EMPIRICISM
------------------------
89. Hume and Peirce deny that anything makes anything happen, but this stems from the pinball-machine conception.
90. Empiricism doesn't demand acceptance of no-cause view (NCV); it demands rejection—we feel forces constantly.
91. NCV may be an attempt to negate the unpleasant fact that we're always under the dominion of forces.
92. Outside physics, correlations don't correlate with laws; non-physicists who believe otherwise harm their disciplines.

BELIEF-SYSTEM DESTABILIZATION
-----------------------------
93. Discovering parents are demeritorious destabilizes one's belief-system.
94. Minor destabilizations are harmless and necessary for knowledge acquisition and personal growth.
95. If excessively disrupted, one's belief-system may become insufficiently operative.
96. Emotional damage may lead to crippling disruptions of belief-system and practical decision-making.

RATIONALIZATION AND SOCIOPATHY
------------------------------
97. A rationalization may be counterproductive in one way but productive in another—guaranteeing survival but prohibiting growth.
98. The boot-licker keeps his job but diminishes himself; he exchanges uncertainty of meaning for certainty of meaninglessness.
99. A sociopathogenic rationalization is one that turns one into a sociopath by corrupting conscience and eroding values.
100. Sociopathy is not a mild form of psychopathy; they are distinct disorders, though identical in certain respects.

POSITIONS EXTRACTED FROM: EMPIRICISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY (Part 10)
===================================================================================

IDENTITY AND SELF-CHANGE
-------------------------
1. One can change oneself, but one cannot change one's self.
2. Sally is committing psychological suicide by trying to change who she is, not how she is.
3. One's identity is predetermined; experience doesn't determine who one is but how one is who one is.
4. Studies of identical twins raised apart show they are identical in IQ, spirituality, and social traits.
5. Changes to oneself, if they are not to render one's self defunct, must occur within limits set by inborn biological structure.
6. Intelligence is applied in accordance with one's values to problems relating to preservation or augmentation of one's agency.

SOCIOPATHIZATION
----------------
7. Only value-based psychological architectures can undergo sociopathization.
8. To be a sociopath is to have a personality-structure that once embodied values but no longer does.
9. Rationalizations are moralizations: attempts to make the immoral seem moral.
10. Sociopathy-conducive rationalizations are dispositive of correct, even hyper-correct, conduct and speech.
11. A genuinely moral person will inevitably say and do things others describe as immoral, though they're hyper-moral.
12. Propriety and morality overlap, but the degree of overlap is not 100%.
13. Sociopathogenesis is psychological suicide.
14. At some level, sociopaths are aware of what they've lost and resent those who haven't lost it.
15. Nobody wants others to have what they have given up; misery loves company.

SOCIOPATHS VS. PSYCHOPATHS
--------------------------
16. Sociopaths make a show of being friendly but don't have friends, for they don't have values.
17. A friend is somebody one values; sociopaths cannot have friends.
18. To the extent sociopaths behave authentically, they are unremittingly undermining.
19. The sociopath wants to believe himself legitimate; his descent was inaugurated by a master-rationalization.
20. Since the sociopath's rationalization attempts to legitimate him, he is bound by some mimicry of morality.
21. Psychopathy is neither initiated nor constituted by a master-rationalization.
22. The psychopath doesn't care about being legitimate; he doesn't know what legitimacy is.
23. The psychopath knows what behaviors are associated with "legitimate" and "good" but doesn't grasp the concepts.
24. The psychopath isn't bound by any code of honor, not even the wooden formal sort binding the sociopath.

PSYCHOPATHY: NATURE AND CHARACTERISTICS
---------------------------------------
25. To be a psychopath is to be a fraud—a nobody disguised as a somebody.
26. The essence of psychopathy is phoniness, not criminality.
27. Criminality is a frequent by-product of psychopathy, nothing more.
28. A complete fraud can't be an agent, and vice versa.
29. Psychopaths are evasive; when asked a question, they respond with lectures or dramatic performances.
30. The psychopath thereby avoids answering while making onlookers think he knows the answer.
31. The psychopath's sources of enjoyment are but a small subset of the non-psychopath's.
32. The psychopath must cleave to what is perceptible; nothing else brings him enjoyment except discharging basal urges.

SERIAL KILLERS
--------------
33. Only an infinitesimally small percentage of psychopaths are serial killers, but most serial killers are psychopaths.
34. Some authors hold serial killers have an even more rudimentary psychological integration than psychopaths.
35. Some serial killers (Bundy, Gacy) are psychopaths; others (Ridgeway) may be "just serial killers" without psychopathic traits.
36. In some cases, serial murder expresses a unitary pathological deviation; in others, a confluence of forces.

PSYCHOPATHIC SEXUALITY
----------------------
37. Psychopaths are notoriously good at seducing but derive little pleasure from intercourse per se.
38. Psychopaths enjoy acts of deception leading to intercourse; some regard the sexual act as pure aggression.
39. Rapists are categorically psychopaths, though not all psychopaths are rapists.
40. Human beings are the only creatures with "off-season" sexual intercourse because we have values.
41. We infuse carnal acts with values, making them enjoyable in ways impossible for value-free creatures.
42. Psychopaths lack a well-defined sexual identity; they can have sex with anybody—male, female, young, old.
43. For psychopaths, physical intimacy has none of the valuative concomitants it has in ordinary cases.
44. The psychopath's sexual amorphousness is often mistaken for open-mindedness or spiritual gifts.

NON-PSYCHOPATHIC SEXUALITY
--------------------------
45. For non-psychopaths, intercourse is fraught with emotion; aesthetic preferences connect to object-relations with valued people.
46. Men are drawn to women for looks largely because they unconsciously associate desired character traits with those looks.
47. If a woman lacks the psychological properties unconsciously sought, the man will likely lose interest despite physical resemblance.

PSYCHOPATHIC INTELLIGENCE
-------------------------
48. Psychopaths can be found in almost every profession: physicians, law professors, engineers.
49. In professions where fraud is possible, the psychopath's successes are likely to be fraudulent.
50. Psychopaths can be genuinely brilliant, but their intelligence has a peculiar variety and design.
51. The psychopath wants his talents capable of being put on display at a moment's notice.
52. The psychopath's talents are like a cubist painting: everything pressed into two dimensions, all on the surface.
53. The non-psychopath's talents are like a computer: visible operations hint at vastly more complex underlying operations.
54. The psychopath-savant's expertise tends to contain strange, foundational gaps.
55. The supposedly Herculean intellect of a psychopath lacks something integral to a genuinely Herculean intellect.

PSYCHOPATHY AND SPECULATION
---------------------------
56. Psychopathy can facilitate legitimate intelligence development in one respect.
57. The non-psychopath's conscience-based concessions to rigor make him timid and unwilling to speculate.
58. The psychopath's lack of conscience allows bold speculation unimpeded by standards of evidence.

PSYCHOPATHS VS. INFANTS
-----------------------
59. The psychopath is not just a giant infant; infants aren't psychopaths.
60. A giant infant would be innocent; psychopaths are not innocent.
61. The psychopath's cognitive development may be normal or hyper-normal except as stunted by lack of characterological development.
62. Many a "child prodigy" turns out to be a psychopath, as is many an "adult savant."

SOCIOPATHIC TREACHERY
---------------------
63. The sociopath drains truthfulness of value by being honest in furtherance of large-scale deceptions.
64. By being moral in furtherance of large-scale injustices, the sociopath drains morality of meaning.
65. The non-sociopathic liar-predator merely saves his own skin; the sociopath tries to undermine virtue itself.
66. There is a gulf between official and actual morality, between official and actual truth.
67. There are social incentives to endorse official morality and disincentives to endorse actual morality.
68. Institutional truth and morality are obvious and unambiguous; authentic counterparts are subtle and equivocal.
69. Given these facts, the sociopath can lie and predate while remaining on the right side of institutional truth.

SOCIOPATHIC EPISTEMOLOGY
------------------------
70. The sociopath doesn't really believe or disbelieve anything.
71. Sociopaths must believe that truth is malleable, that facts conform to wishes.
72. Sociopaths must believe truth, morality, and merit are "relative" and a "matter of opinion."
73. By countenancing belief-transcendent reality, one robs one's rationalizations of credibility.
74. For the sociopath, there is no distinction between thought and rationalization.
75. Only a person with values can maintain a sharp mental distinction between actual truth and its surrogates.

SOCIOPATHIZATION PROCESS
------------------------
76. Sociopathization is immediately preceded by a brief but intense period of psychosis.
77. This psychosis is preceded by years of pretending things were fine when they weren't.
78. Sociopathy is never reversible; it is systemic psychosis, not system-internal psychosis.
79. So far as the sociopath seems to be getting better, it's because he is getting worse.
80. There is nothing one loses upon sociopathizing that one will ever regain except in degraded form.

WRITING AND SOCIOPATHY
----------------------
81. The craft of writing seems exceptionally sociopathogenic.
82. The rationalizations mediating sociopathization can be identical with the writer's work-product.
83. Compositions cannot undermine one another; the composer qua composer cannot step on anyone's toes.
84. One cannot be by lying that a composer popularizes his work, whereas a writer often popularizes through lying.

CRIMINALS VS. PSYCHOPATHS
-------------------------
85. A criminal is someone whose psychological architecture is intact but whose object-relations to fellow citizens resemble a soldier's to enemy troops.
86. Unlike sociopaths and psychopaths, criminals can and do have meaningful object-relations with others.
87. The criminal really loves his wife; he has a best friend; he cares about his child's troubles.
88. When transacting with marks, the criminal sees them as a soldier sees the enemy.
89. The criminal can have meaningful object-relations; the psychopath cannot.
90. The criminal must suspend his object-relations to ply his trade; the psychopath has none to suspend.
91. The ability to have meaningful connection presupposes ability to have values.
92. If the criminal can connect meaningfully with even one person, he has values and is thus an agent.

EVIL VS. HATE
-------------
93. Evil must be distinguished from hate; everyone hates someone, but not everyone is evil.
94. Evil is generalized, rigidified hate.
95. Your hatred is person-specific (Jerry); Stalin's targeted humanity itself.
96. Wickedness and criminality are not mutually exclusive; a given agent can be both.
97. The "anti-social" group actually consists of five distinct groups: psychopaths, sociopaths, criminals, evil people, and haters.

EMPIRICISM AND THE UNCONSCIOUS
------------------------------
98. There is no way to understand repression or rationalization in strictly empiricist terms.
99. The hypothesis of unconscious mental activity is the ultimate deviation from empiricism's strictures.
100. There is no way to explain conscious mental activity except on the assumption of unconscious mental activity.
