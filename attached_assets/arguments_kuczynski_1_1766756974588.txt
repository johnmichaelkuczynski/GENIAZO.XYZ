### Argument 2 (deductive)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**

**Premises:**
- Determinism: The doctrine that how the world is at any point in time fixes how it will be at all later times.

## Supervenience and Its Implications

### Argument 68 (causal)

**Premises:**
- No creature can possibly predict what it will come to know.

---

### Argument 70 (deductive)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- One fact which falls within the scope of science is that, in order to learn about the world, we must interact with it.
- Another such fact is that interactions have effects.
- These two facts entail that what we can learn about the world at time t doesn’t correspond with perfect precision to the world at time t.

**→ Conclusion:** Given that two facts that do fall within the scope of science entail that there are things about the world that cannot be known, it follows that, for science no less than for metaphysics, the world is to some extent unknowable.

### Argument 72 (deductive)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- If x and y are identical in respect of their microphysical properties, then it is inconceivable that they should differ in respect of their biological properties.

### Argument 73 (deductive)
**Author:** Kuczynski

**Premises:**
- One fact which falls within the scope of science is that, in order to learn about the world, we must interact with it.
