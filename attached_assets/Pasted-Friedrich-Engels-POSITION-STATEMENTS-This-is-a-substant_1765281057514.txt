Friedrich Engels POSITION STATEMENTS 

This is a substantial compilation. I'll work through all 28 topics systematically.

---

## ORIGINAL 20 TOPICS

### 1. Historical Materialism

1. The mode of production of material life conditions social, political, and intellectual processes generally—consciousness does not determine being, but social being determines consciousness.
2. History proceeds through necessary stages of development (primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism, socialism) driven by contradictions between productive forces and relations of production.
3. Ideas, religions, philosophies, and legal systems are superstructural phenomena ultimately traceable to the economic base of society.
4. Historical change occurs through class struggle, which is the motor of history in all written records of human civilization.
5. The transition between modes of production occurs when productive forces outgrow existing relations of production, creating revolutionary situations.

### 2. The Condition of the Working Class

1. Industrial capitalism systematically degrades workers physically, morally, and intellectually through exploitative conditions, long hours, and subsistence wages.
2. The bourgeoisie commits "social murder" through deliberate neglect—inadequate housing, sanitation, and nutrition that predictably kills workers.
3. The reserve army of labor (unemployed workers) is structurally necessary to capitalism to depress wages and discipline employed workers.
4. Working-class neighborhoods are deliberately segregated from bourgeois areas, rendering poverty invisible to those who profit from it.
5. The proletariat's misery is not accidental but a necessary consequence of capitalism's internal logic of accumulation.

### 3. Origin of Family, Private Property, and State

1. The monogamous patriarchal family arose not from natural affection but from the need to transmit private property through verified male lineage.
2. The state is not a neutral arbiter but an instrument of class rule that arose to protect property relations and suppress exploited classes.
3. Primitive societies practiced group marriage and matrilineal descent; the "world-historic defeat of the female sex" occurred with the rise of private property.
4. The state will wither away under communism because its function—managing class antagonisms—will disappear when classes disappear.
5. Civilization itself is inseparable from exploitation; every advance has simultaneously been a regression for the subjected class.

### 4. Dialectics and Dialectical Materialism

1. The three laws of dialectics: transformation of quantity into quality, interpenetration of opposites, and negation of the negation.
2. Dialectics is not imposed on nature but extracted from it—nature itself proceeds dialectically through contradiction and development.
3. Formal logic is valid but limited; it captures static relations but cannot grasp motion, development, and qualitative transformation.
4. All things contain internal contradictions that drive their development and eventual transformation into something qualitatively different.
5. Dialectical thinking overcomes the rigid either/or of metaphysical thought, recognizing that opposites interpenetrate and things can be simultaneously themselves and not-themselves.

### 5. Critique of Political Economy

1. Classical political economy (Smith, Ricardo) correctly identified labor as the source of value but failed to analyze the specifically capitalist form of exploitation.
2. Surplus value—unpaid labor appropriated by capitalists—is the secret of capitalist profit, rent, and interest.
3. Capitalism's internal contradictions (overproduction, falling rate of profit, concentration of capital) make it inherently crisis-prone and historically transient.
4. The categories of bourgeois economics (wages, profit, rent) are not natural but historically specific forms that mystify exploitation.
5. Economic crises are not accidents but necessary expressions of capitalism's fundamental contradiction between social production and private appropriation.

### 6. Scientific vs. Utopian Socialism

1. Utopian socialists (Fourier, Owen, Saint-Simon) correctly diagnosed capitalism's injustices but proposed solutions based on moral appeals rather than historical analysis.
2. Scientific socialism grounds itself in the actual laws of historical development, recognizing socialism as the necessary outcome of capitalism's contradictions.
3. Socialism cannot be willed into existence by enlightened reformers; it requires the development of productive forces and class consciousness of the proletariat.
4. The utopians' plans for ideal communities were historically premature—the material conditions and class forces for socialism had not yet matured.
5. Despite their limitations, the utopians contributed genuine insights (critique of competition, vision of cooperative production) that scientific socialism incorporates.

### 7. The Role of Labor in Human Evolution

1. Labor is the primary condition of human existence—so much so that labor created humanity itself.
2. The hand is both the organ and product of labor; its development through tool use drove brain development and eventually language.
3. The transition from ape to human occurred through the adoption of upright posture, which freed the hands for increasingly complex manipulation.
4. Human beings distinguish themselves from animals by producing their means of subsistence, thereby indirectly producing their material life.
5. The social character of labor—cooperative production requiring communication—drove the development of language and abstract thought.

### 8. Military Science and Strategy

1. Military organization reflects the economic and social structure of the society that produces it; armies are not autonomous from class relations.
2. The nation-in-arms (mass conscription) is historically superior to professional mercenary armies, as demonstrated by revolutionary France.
3. Industrial development transforms warfare—railways, telegraphs, rifled artillery, and mass production fundamentally alter strategic possibilities.
4. The proletariat must study military science because revolution requires armed force; the ruling class will not peacefully surrender power.
5. Technological developments in weaponry tend toward making wars more destructive and potentially unwinnable, creating contradictions for militaristic states.

### 9. The Housing Question

1. The housing shortage is not an accident but a necessary product of capitalist urbanization and the commodification of shelter.
2. Proudhonist solutions (making workers homeowners) would not solve the housing crisis but would tie workers to particular locations, reducing labor mobility.
3. The bourgeoisie "solves" housing problems by displacing them—slum clearance merely shifts poverty elsewhere while raising rents.
4. Only the abolition of the antithesis between town and country through socialist reorganization can solve the housing question.
5. Housing reform under capitalism ameliorates symptoms but cannot address the structural causes rooted in private property and urban land speculation.

### 10. The Peasant Question

1. The peasantry is not a homogeneous class but divided into rich peasants (rural bourgeoisie), middle peasants, and poor peasants/agricultural laborers.
2. Small peasant agriculture is economically doomed by capitalist competition; the socialist movement should not promise to preserve it artificially.
3. The proletariat must win the peasantry as allies, particularly poor peasants whose interests align with workers against large landowners and capitalists.
4. Collectivization of agriculture should proceed by example and persuasion, not compulsion—peasants must see its advantages demonstrated.
5. The German peasant wars of the 16th century failed because the peasantry could not unite with urban plebeians under a coherent revolutionary program.

### 11. Anti-Dühring (Critique of Dühring)

1. Dühring's system-building is pseudo-scientific dogmatism masquerading as comprehensive truth—genuine science proceeds through revision, not eternal axioms.
2. Dühring's "force theory" of history inverts causation: political force is itself conditioned by economic development, not vice versa.
3. Equality is not an eternal moral truth but a historically conditioned demand that takes different forms in different epochs.
4. Dühring's eclecticism combines incompatible elements (idealism, materialism, positivism) without recognizing their contradictions.
5. Philosophy as a separate discipline above the sciences ends with the recognition that philosophy's only remaining task is logic and dialectics.

### 12. Dialectics of Nature

1. Nature exhibits dialectical development—transformations of quantity into quality, interpenetration of opposites, and spiral development through negation.
2. The natural sciences confirm materialism: matter is primary, and mind/consciousness emerged from matter through natural processes.
3. The rigid boundaries between sciences (physics, chemistry, biology) are breaking down as each discovers transformations and transitions.
4. The mechanistic materialism of the 18th century must be superseded by dialectical materialism that grasps development and qualitative change.
5. The conservation and transformation of energy is a fundamental natural-scientific confirmation of the dialectical principle of interconnection.

### 13. The German Ideology

1. The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas—the class controlling material production controls mental production.
2. German idealist philosophy (Hegel, Young Hegelians) mistakes the movement of ideas for the movement of history itself.
3. Individuals are not abstract bearers of consciousness but concrete beings whose consciousness is shaped by their material life activity.
4. The division of labor creates the illusion that intellectual activity is autonomous from material production.
5. Communism is not an ideal to be realized but the real movement abolishing the present state of things—it arises from existing contradictions.

### 14. The Communist Manifesto

1. The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.
2. The bourgeoisie has played a revolutionary role in history, destroying feudal relations and developing productive forces on an unprecedented scale.
3. Capitalism produces its own gravediggers—the proletariat, whose growth, concentration, and organization are necessary products of capitalist development.
4. Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties; they represent the movement's general interests across national boundaries.
5. The proletarian revolution will abolish private property in the means of production, ending exploitation and class division.

### 15. Ludwig Feuerbach and Classical German Philosophy

1. Feuerbach's materialism is contemplative, not practical—he fails to grasp that changing circumstances requires revolutionary activity.
2. Hegel's dialectic is rational in kernel but mystical in form; it must be turned right-side up to yield historical materialism.
3. The fundamental question of philosophy is the relation of thinking to being; materialism and idealism are the two great camps.
4. Philosophy reaches its end in the recognition that it must give way to positive science and the practical transformation of the world.
5. Feuerbach dissolves religion into its human essence but fails to explain why humans produce religious alienation—that requires analyzing material conditions.

### 16. Origins of Christianity

1. Early Christianity was a movement of the oppressed—slaves, freedmen, and the poor—expressing real suffering in religious form.
2. Christianity succeeded because it offered consolation and community to those crushed by the Roman Empire's exploitation.
3. The transformation of Christianity from a revolutionary movement into a state religion involved its capture by ruling-class interests.
4. Religious movements are distorted expressions of real social conflicts; their content must be translated into material terms.
5. Parallels exist between early Christian communities and modern socialist movements—both emerge from conditions of oppression and promise liberation.

### 17. The German Peasant War

1. The Peasant War of 1525 was the most radical episode of the German Reformation, going beyond religious reform to demand social transformation.
2. Thomas Müntzer represented the revolutionary plebeian-peasant wing, while Luther sided with the princes against popular uprising.
3. The peasantry's failure stemmed from localism—inability to unite nationally against the princely and ecclesiastical powers.
4. The German bourgeoisie's weakness (compared to England and France) dates from the defeat of the peasant revolution.
5. Revolutionary movements require alignment between progressive class forces and adequate material conditions; the 16th century lacked both.

### 18. Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany

1. The revolutions of 1848 failed because the German bourgeoisie feared the proletariat more than it desired victory over feudal reaction.
2. The bourgeoisie's betrayal of democratic revolution demonstrates that the proletariat cannot rely on bourgeois leadership for democratic tasks.
3. Counter-revolution succeeds when revolutionary forces are divided, exhausted, or lack clear political leadership.
4. Small German states and particularism weakened revolutionary coordination; national unification was historically progressive.
5. The lessons of 1848 include the necessity of independent proletarian organization and the inadequacy of purely parliamentary tactics.

### 19. The Role of Force in History

1. Force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one—revolution accelerates historical transitions.
2. Political power grows out of economic power; the state's monopoly of force ultimately serves economic class interests.
3. Force alone cannot create new social relations; it can only clear obstacles to developments already prepared by economic evolution.
4. The bourgeoisie itself came to power through revolutionary force against feudalism, despite its current preaching of peaceful reform.
5. The military and state apparatus, as instruments of force, will be required by the proletariat to suppress bourgeois counter-revolution.

### 20. The Withering Away of the State

1. The state is a product of irreconcilable class antagonisms; when classes disappear, the state loses its function and withers away.
2. The proletarian state (dictatorship of the proletariat) is a transitional form that suppresses bourgeois resistance while preparing its own dissolution.
3. Government over persons is replaced by administration of things—coordination of production without class coercion.
4. The state cannot be abolished by decree; it withers as the conditions necessitating it (class division, scarcity) are overcome.
5. Engels distinguished between smashing the bourgeois state apparatus and using a proletarian state for the transition period.

## ADDITIONAL TOPICS

### 21. Economics

1. The labor theory of value: all value in commodities derives from socially necessary labor time; profit represents unpaid labor (surplus value).
2. Capitalism's fundamental contradiction is between socialized production (workers cooperating in large enterprises) and private appropriation (capitalist ownership of products).
3. Economic crises of overproduction are endemic to capitalism—not from producing too much for human need but too much for profitable sale.
4. The tendency of the rate of profit to fall (due to rising organic composition of capital) drives capitalism toward crisis and monopolization.
5. Money is not a neutral medium but a social relation; its fetishized appearance conceals the exploitative relations underlying commodity exchange.

### 22. The Hand and Human Psychology

1. The hand's liberation through upright posture enabled tool use, which in turn drove the development of the brain and intelligence.
2. The hand is simultaneously an organ of labor and a product of labor—its refinement occurred through countless generations of increasingly skilled work.
3. Tool use required planning, foresight, and coordination, stimulating the development of higher cognitive functions.
4. Social labor necessitated communication, and the hand's gestures likely contributed to the emergence of language alongside vocal development.
5. Human psychology is fundamentally shaped by labor; our cognitive capacities evolved to serve practical transformation of nature, not abstract contemplation.

### 23. Origins of the Family

1. The monogamous family is not natural or eternal but arose with private property to ensure transmission of wealth through verified paternal lineage.
2. Prior to private property, various forms of group marriage and matrilineal descent prevailed; paternity was uncertain and socially unimportant.
3. Women's subordination ("the world-historic defeat of the female sex") coincided with the rise of private property and men's need to control reproduction.
4. Monogamy from its origin was monogamy for the woman only—men maintained access to prostitution, concubinage, and adultery.
5. True individual sex-love will only be possible under communism, when marriage is freed from property considerations and economic dependence.

### 24. Economic Invariants (Universal Economic Structures)

1. All societies must produce and reproduce the material conditions of life—the organization of production is universal even as its forms vary.
2. Division of labor exists in all societies, though its character (natural/sexual vs. social/class-based) differs historically.
3. Some form of distribution and circulation of products is necessary in all societies, whether through reciprocity, redistribution, or exchange.
4. Cooperation in production—social labor—is a universal human characteristic distinguishing humanity from other animals.
5. The metabolism between humanity and nature (transforming natural materials through labor) is the invariant foundation of all economic life.

### 25. Influence of Evolutionary Theory

1. Darwin's theory confirmed the materialist conception of nature—species arise through natural processes without divine intervention or teleological design.
2. Evolution demonstrates that all rigid categories are provisional; species, like social forms, undergo continuous development and transformation.
3. The struggle for existence in nature should not be mechanically applied to society; human cooperation can transcend Malthusian competition.
4. Engels saw social evolution as continuous with biological evolution but operating through different mechanisms (inheritance of acquired social organization through culture, not genes).
5. Evolution's destruction of fixed species concepts paralleled dialectics' critique of rigid, unchanging categories in philosophy.

### 26. Conventional Moral Views (Kantian, Millian)

1. All morality is historically conditioned; there is no eternal moral law valid for all times and places.
2. Kantian ethics' categorical imperative is an abstract formalism that cannot derive concrete duties without smuggling in historically specific content.
3. Utilitarian calculation assumes a universal human nature and ignores that conceptions of happiness are class-conditioned and historically variable.
4. Bourgeois morality (respect for property, contract, individual rights) reflects and legitimates capitalist social relations.
5. Truly human morality—beyond class morality—will only emerge in classless society; until then, proletarian morality represents the most progressive tendency.

### 27. Trade Unions

1. Trade unions are necessary schools of class struggle, teaching workers the value of combination against capital.
2. Unions' defensive struggles for wages and conditions are legitimate and important but insufficient—they fight effects without abolishing causes.
3. Unions must not limit themselves to narrow economic demands but engage in political struggle for working-class emancipation.
4. The economic struggle alone cannot overcome capitalism; unions must ally with socialist parties pursuing political power.
5. Union consciousness (pure trade unionism) differs from socialist consciousness; the latter must be developed through political education and organization.

### 28. Relations Between the Genders

1. Women's oppression originated with private property and the patriarchal family's need to control female sexuality for inheritance purposes.
2. Women's domestic labor is socially necessary but unrecognized and unpaid under capitalism—a hidden form of exploitation.
3. Women's emancipation requires their mass entry into social production and the socialization of domestic labor and childcare.
4. Bourgeois marriage is legalized prostitution when women's economic dependence compels them to marry for security rather than love.
5. True equality between sexes will only be achieved under communism when economic compulsion is removed from personal relationships.
