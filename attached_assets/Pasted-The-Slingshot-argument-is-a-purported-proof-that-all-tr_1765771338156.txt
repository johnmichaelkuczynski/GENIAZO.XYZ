The Slingshot argument is a purported proof that all true sentences refer to the same thing—the truth-value True—and all false sentences refer to the same thing—the truth-value False. It does not go through; it is a spurious argument riddled with profound errors concerning the nature of reference and logical equivalence. The argument typically proceeds by attempting to show that any two true sentences are logically equivalent to sentences that co-refer through the substitution of co-referring terms, thereby forcing the conclusion that the original sentences must themselves co-refer. As I state explicitly, "Slingshot-style arguments have been used to prove many things – some of them quite extraordinary. In fact, the Slingshot 'proves' things that aren't true. The Slingshot proves, for example, that your car is identical with Mozart’s favorite wig." This *reductio* demonstrates the absurdity of accepting its conclusion, which signals fundamental flaws in its premises and inferential structure.

The core mechanism of the Slingshot involves two suspect principles: that logically equivalent expressions must co-refer, and that substituting co-referring terms within a context preserves reference. Consider the standard example: take sentence (1) "Mozart was a composer" and sentence (4) "Bill Clinton was U.S. President in 1997." The argument constructs intermediate steps, such as (2) "The class of all things x such that Mozart was a composer and x is self-identical is identical with the class of all things x such that x is self-identical." It is claimed that (1) is logically equivalent to (2). Yet this is where the first error lies. The definite description "the class of all things x such that Mozart was a composer and x is self-identical" is not a straightforward referring term; its analysis is pivotal. If read as a quantifier, there is no logical equivalence between (1) and (2). As I argue, "once we are clear on how we read definite descriptions, the Slingshot crumbles." The purported equivalence is an illusion traded on a confusion between different semantic roles.

Furthermore, the argument makes illegitimate use of Leibniz's Law (LL) or a related principle of substitution. I note that "many Slingshots make spurious use of (LL)." Even granting unrestricted use of LL for the sake of argument, the Slingshot still fails because it conflates sentence-types with sentence-tokens. This conflation is fatal. "The moment we distinguish between sentence-types and sentence-tokens, it becomes very hard to believe that either sentence-types or sentence-tokens refer to truth-values." Sentence-types are abstract objects that do not refer at all; only concrete utterance-tokens or inscription-tokens can refer. A token of "snow is white" refers not to a truth-value but to a proposition, or more precisely, to a function involving a proposition. The Slingshot advocates' refusal to make this distinction allows them to treat sentences as undifferentiated bearers of reference, which is a category mistake.

Another deep error is the confusion of literal meaning with cognitive content and the related confusion of semantics with pre-semantics. Frege's version of the argument, for instance, assumes that co-referring terms like "Socrates" and "the unique thing x such that [Mozart wrote fewer fugues and x=Socrates]" make different semantic contributions. I identify this as based on "a confusion of type-meaning with token-meaning; and a confusion of literal meaning with communicated meaning." When these are straightened out, if two expressions refer to Socrates, they semantically contribute Socrates alone, making the relevant sentences exact synonyms and breaking the supposed chain of non-trivial reference preservation. The Slingshot thus fails by presupposing a flawed, hyper-intensional semantics that cannot be sustained under clear analysis.

Even if one temporarily accepts all the Slingshot's dubious assumptions, internal contradictions emerge. The argument presupposes that meaning can be changed by replacing co-referring terms, yet it also needs the principle that logically equivalent sentences co-refer. These principles interact to produce a collapse. As I point out, "Granting this assumption actually makes the Slingshot fail – even though the Slingshot needs it." For example, in Church's 1943 version, if definite descriptions are read as referring expressions, the steps are not logically equivalent. If they are read as quantifiers, the equivalence also fails. Therefore, "there is no logical equivalence between the first two steps, or the last two. The argument fails." The Slingshot is not sound under any consistent interpretation of its components.

In conclusion, the Slingshot argument is a philosophical failure that does not go through. Its conclusion is absurd, and its premises rely on conflations—between types and tokens, between different kinds of semantic value, and between logical equivalence and material equivalence. A proper semantics, which distinguishes token-reference from type-meaning and recognizes that sentence-tokens refer to propositions or propositional functions, is immune to the Slingshot's spurious reasoning. The argument serves as a cautionary example of how subtle confusions in the philosophy of language can generate dramatic but false metaphysical conclusions, and its definitive failure underscores the necessity for rigorous conceptual precision in semantic theory.
