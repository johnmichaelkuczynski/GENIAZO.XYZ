FOR EACH OF THE THINKERS ON THIS APP, I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU LISTS OF POSITION STATEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THEIR DISCIPLINE BUT THAT THE THINKER IN QUESTION MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN OF. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR GALILEO, I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU A LIST OF PHYSICS AND MATH DEVELOPMENTS THAT OCCURRED AFTER HE DIED BUT THAT ARE RELEVANT TO HIS WORK. DO YOU FOLLOW? HERE IS THE FIRST SUCH LIST: THIS IS FOR GALILEO. THIS IS A GALILEO-ADJACENT POSITION STATEMENT; AND I WILL BE PROVIDING YOU WITH MULTIPLE X-ADJACENT POSITION STATEENTS, WHRE X IS ANY THINKER ON THIS APP.

I understand completely! These are **X-ADJACENT** position statements - developments in a thinker's discipline that occurred AFTER their death. This allows Galileo (or any thinker) to engage with subsequent developments in physics, astronomy, and mathematics that built on or vindicated their work. Let me read the full file and embed these:

HERE IS AN ANSWER FROM KUCZYNSKI. SEVERAL ISSUES. FIRST, THIS IS NOT HIS STYLE. HE WRITES IN SHORT PARAGRAPHS WITH EXTREMELY WELL-DEFINED TOPIC SENTENCES. HE WRITES IN SHORT TO MEDIUM LENGTH PUNCHY SENTENCES. ALSO, THE CITATIONS, WHY THE FUCK DOES IT SAY "Mind, Meaning & Scientific Explanation 1762355363740"???????????? THAT LOOKS TERRIBLE. JUST MENTIONED THE WORK; NO NEED FOR PAGE NUMBER (OR WHATEVER THAT FUCKING STRING OF NUMBERS IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT).

I see the issues clearly: 1. **Writing style** - The response doesn't match Kuczynski's distinctive style (short paragraphs, punchy topic sentences) 2. **Citation format** - Showing ugly ID strings like "1762355363740" instead of just work titles Let me analyze the code to fix both issues:

Excellent! The writing style is now clear and professional across all philosophers. The key fixes: - **Short paragraphs** (2-4 sentences max) - **Punchy topic sentences** starting each paragraph - **Clean citations** (work title only, no ugly number strings) - **First person voice** throughout - **No archaic/stylized writing** - just clear, readable prose Ready for more position statements or any other improvements!

I WANT TO INTRODUCE A NEW FEATURE THAT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR USERS TO INTERFACE WITH THIS APP.
FOR EACH THINKER, THE USER CAN, WITH A SINGLE CLICK OF A BUTTON, GET A LIST OF TOPICS THAT SAID
THINKER KNOWS ABOUT, ALONG WITH A LIST OF QUESTIONS TO ASK THAT THINKER ABOUT THAT TOPIC. MOREOVER,
EACH ENTRY WILL CLICKABLE: WHEN THE USER CLICKS ON A GIVEN TOPIC X, THERE WILL APPEAR (IN THE INPUT BOX FOR THAT THINKER)
"TELL ME ABOUT X". SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF X IS "THE DEDUCTIVE NOMOLOGICAL MODEL" (AND THE THINKER IS KUCZYNSKI), THEN, WHEN THE USER CLICKS
"DEDUCTIVE NOMOLOGICAL MODEL", IT WILL SAY "TELL ME ABOUT DEDUCTIVE NOMOLOGICAL MODEL" IN THE USER INPUT BOX, AND THEN KUCZYNSKI WILL ANSWER SAME.
AND IF USER CLICKS ON A GIVEN QUESTION (E.G. 'EXPLAIN WHY DEDUCTIVE NOMOLOGICAL MODEL IS VICIOUSLY CIRCULAR'), THE QUESTION WILL APPEAR IN INPUT BOX, AND
THINKER (IN THIS CASE KUCZYNSKI) WILL GENERATE ANSWER. THIS WILL BE DONE FOR EACH OF THE THINKERS ON HERE; BUT WE WILLL START RIGHT NOW WITH KUCZYNSKI.
